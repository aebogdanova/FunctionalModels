3864	It'd be nice if the app would open. Says, &amp;#34;you do not own the app&amp;#34;, and then &amp;#34;network internal service error&amp;#34;. All the Amazon apps that I download does this. WTF?	1
7357	I installed this because it said underground and saw the permissions flash after i hit install. Wtf do you need to record audio from my device for? Or read my external sd card for? Or turn on my camera or flash for? Did you guys sell out to the cia? Explain the reason for these permissions in detail to me please. I'll just switch to a different company all together or shop direct.  Id rather get price gouged than be recorded.  The only thing you should need to do is mail me stuff,  email me, and accept my money. If you're not protecting my interests then im not buying from you.	1

15138	IMBD menue of the cast's actors pop up when in full screen mode and obstructs view.  There was no option to close it either.  WTF?!	1

40396	This game is so terrible. It says it's free so o download It. Then it says I have to pay . 99 cents!! WTF!	1
41493	It would be nice if you could play more than 1 game a day. Getting coins once a day with a spin...sucks. also it would be nice if there was a thesaurus attached because I have lost games for this alone. For example one question was name something about Santa kids make fun of..my answer is his stomach, after 3rd strike it shows the answer and number one answer was his belly, ugg wtf  I uninstalled this app.	1
50734	I had $60,000 in my account and opened it today and had $0. WTF am I bothering to play for????	1

62220	I've been receiving automatic updates daily for the past two weeks.....WTF!!!!! STOP with the freaking updates!!!!	1
62962	They describe it as an app, when in reality it's only half an app..which they don't tell you.they allow you to look at a few planets, but to see the rest ..you must pay..WTF. The half I got is great..	2

67999	This app just completely failed. I was not even able to open it to try it out because when it was halfway installed to my kindle fire, a popup came up saying that the app was unable to be installed on my device. WTF amazon just say it is incompatible and this would have never happened!	1
69166	I've been using this for a while on my LG G4. Today I went to use it and my phone is no longer supported. Wtf??	1
70161	Horrible garbage. Add to the play store wtf are you doing	1
70428	I spent to much dumb time trying to beat that dumb tutorial an  for what? For  a dumb credit saying you need the full game to play wtf add at least 5 levels come on it sucks man	1
70990	The thing is it wont shoot or release the ki blast. Wtf!?! Fix FOR THE TABLET AND IPHNE 6	2
82653	I was really into this game, it was simple, mindless, and worked offline (great for long airplane trips) -- until I had to factory reset my device because of slow performance. I don't think the game had anything to do with it, but there is NO WAY to save your game and transfer it to another device! Hours of dedication to building a tiny little world and it was gone :( On one hand, I was slightly glad for it, because now it's hold over me is broken, on the other, WTF, Gameloft? At least I hadn't spent a penny on any of the in-game purchases, unlike others who have had similar experiences. Uninstalling and not going back.	1
88376	I love it its a grate game but to have a hint you need to rate this app 5 stars wtf ! but anyway its a good scary game I love it its the best in game in the world that I could have thank you hunted house weird game.	5
92898	5 reasons this game is pointless.<br />1. People younger than 13 cant play. Thats stuped!why should anybody play a game when you dont even get to play!?The only way to get in the game is if you lie when your like IDK 11?8?Thats just plain stuped.<br /><br />2.Its boring! Buy a farm, Make a war troop, Heal, Talk,ladidadida...<br />ALWAYS THE SAME!!When will something unexpected come!?  &amp;#34;Wars are unexpected&amp;#34; you say.<br />BUT GUESS WHAT!?You fight, All that time!!!!<br /><br />3.ARENT THERE ENOUGH WAR GAMES IN THE WORLD?!Play those instead!WE DO NOT NEED MORE WAR GAMES IN THE WORLD!!ESPECIALLY NOT STUPED ONES!!<br /><br />4.If you lose. Your gonna die, And youll lose all your progress.WHATS THE POINT OF PLAYING A GAME WHEN YOU DONT GO QUICK!? But guess what!?Youll run out of everything you need. AAAND!Then everyone will starve and youll lose all your progress, AGAIN!<br /><br />5.What if you are in an emwrgency and your saving people but you have to WAIT!!!Whithout the stuff that helps you speed up, By the time you get back everyone will be killed by a war team or something. WTF!!!!!!???<br /><br />I dont reccomend this, EVER!!!!!	1
93861	I love amazon and I used to love the app, but the new version is just too invasive. Record audio, really!! Record video, really!! Monitor incoming SMS messages and record them, send SMS messages, monitor and access to all accounts on device, outrageous!!! AMAZON WTF!!!	1
94874	Y'all some no life having gotta watch wtf I do	5
104549	My 8 year old son was,excited to play this game, but 10 minutes into playing he got his first &amp;#34;mission&amp;#34; and it was to log into Facebook.  The task even said &amp;#34; Every time someone logs into Facebook, a baby Dino smiles! Don't you want to see them smile!?&amp;#34;  Seriously!!!!  Since he is 5 years away from legally having a Facebook account, he can't complete this task and as he put it, &amp;#34;won't be able to complete this mission to play the game.&amp;#34;  WTF Dino Pets, you know this game wasn't made for adults and teenagers, come on!!!	1
106442	The application allows you edit office docs on the with a few caveats, including:<br /><br />* standard Microsoft fonts must be purchased separately which makes sense if you do not own Windows, but there should be some method to download them free by providing your registration key... Why should I have to purchase something I already own?<br /><br />* editing tables is seriously limited... you cannot edit borders  and applying styles is clumsy at best<br /><br />* default margins are .98 inches WTF?<br /><br />I primarily use the application to edit text. So, I cannot speak for the efficacy of the other components. All in all, it is a good application, but further development is needed.	4
109327	Ok well um it worked for my kindle for almost a month and then it stopped working so it sucks now because I cant delete it off my kindle it wont work o.o im serious I tried and it also stopped working like wow so I cant access it either and it wont delete off my systom period like wtf? So kindle fire users do not get this application cx	1
118194	So I get on my kindle and go to play agar.io and find this piece of crap app where agar.io was. Wtf happened to this app. Agar.io was good but this app sucks!	2
121675	I don't know if Amazon puts these apps through a trial or not. If they don't,they should. I can't believe how many negative app reviews I've read,because they simply don't work. I've been trying to find an app that will allow me to stream football matches. When this works,it's a great app. But the videos constantly slow down,until they stop altogether. It's pointless to even try to watch it. And the problem gets worse as time goes on. Now,as soon as the video starts streaming,it starts. I reported the issue,thinking that the people who designed it would see it,but it goes directly to Amazon,who sent me an e-mail with a link to troubleshooting questions. But it only covers problems with their appstore. WTF? My problem is with the app,not the store! So this negative review is about Amazon too. No surprise that their ads work perfectly fine. No problem whatsoever with those videos! Imagine that! This is the only soccer streaming app I've that's close to working. Which isn't saying much.	1
122513	Great app but you people always put in the pictures stuff that you can't buy in the game wtf?????	3
126820	It scrolls down a little ways then stops. It won't load any more content in the feed! WTF?	1
129036	Its cannot maintain the og picture quality and automatically close app during saving time I made an photo with lots of changes and it take 1 hour but during save its close WTF u doing amzona and kvadgroup where is upddte amazon sucks	1

134451	Had it for months after release....used it last night fine, but now it tell me that the app is unavailable for this device. So I uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times and the same message appears. Also tried with phone network and on my personal WiFi and still same message. Looked on amazon page and it says my droid turbo running Android is compatible, so WTF!!! PLEASE tell me why I can't use app anymore....I don't want to be stuck looking at movies on my laptop or have to drag it everywhere....ph app is so much more convenient!!!!	1
136369	Amazon Prime music has the stations so you can choose which genre of music you want to listen to, cool.  I like 80's music, so i was excited to see an 80's Pop station.  I started listening to it being diligent to rate the music I like vs the stuff I don't like, then all of a sudden I start hearing artists like Justin Timberlake, Avril Lavigne and Jason Mraz.  WTF Amazon.  Do you guys not know when the 80's were?  How hard is it to write code that tells the station, if the song wasn't released between 1980 and 1989 then it's not 80's music....Your stations suck, and i'm going back to the free Pandora.  I'd rather listen to a 30 second add than music that doesn't make sense.	1
137355	Since the update it don't let me play the game like wtf ludia	1
138357	No mixtapes? Wtf spotify. That means I have to leave the app when some fire drop....	4
139041	Seems like a scam to get your info. Couldn't watch on demand or live. WTF? Are all the positive reviews paid for or what?<br /><br />0 stars	1
141584	It makes fart sounds every time u play wtf!!!	1
154118	Umm WTF video what too do...and this game just sucks soo bye bye game...I mean it doesn't give you a hint about what to do and there's like no logic....I don't like it...üòëüòëüòëüòëüòëüò°	1
159881	No issues with the video streaming on tablet, world going<br />HOWEVER, WTF is going on with making us use a web browser to search and select videos to watch. Amazon, you must be insane.	1
164786	When they recently updated the game, all my coins (1,600, 000) disappeared and they reset me back to level 1(I was on level 193). 4days later they restored me to my previous level. Now I'm back to level 1. WTF!	1
166821	every time I do something good it turns me to a page that I have to login into my facebook account and I dont have one the I click play as guest it makes me start over like wtf.	1
170684	i'm only giving this a one star cuz i keep trying to buy this app my android device says buy it on my computer i attempt to buy it on my computer an it says download the app amazon app wtf is this endless loop all i want is to buy the game	1
177836	Ok.... wtf? Great and cute game about fnaf. I'll tell you something though: Say yes to baloon boy or he kills you. Springtrap kills you either way. Freddy will hump you. And foxy will marry you... jesus this is too much for a fnaf-loving guy like me	5
180078	This is wtf is up oooooohhhhh yeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhh	5
180458	Yesterday it worked perfect now today it is telling me that it is unavailable on my Android phone. Umm WTF Amazon. Fix this !!!	2
182695	I've played this game now for a while. I'm hooked, I would love to give it 5 stars, what took those stars away is this, playing game get to end you see you've out done yourself on points but wait for it...... your game freezes and your points are gone and your energy is now gone with it. Wtf???, it has done this several times. I could be in front of router or not still happens. My thing is this ok so I lost my points but now my energy has been depleted and there's now way of getting this back. I know you can fix this, if it keeps happening I will drop game. Too, frustrating to keep playing watching your achievements sliding by. Please fix!!!!	3
183614	This is a fun and challenging little word game. Some of the answers are not so obvious almost to the point of being wtf but still guessable.	4
183765	All I have to say is thanks for crashing my kindle fire<br />WTF  why I no move	1
183966	I got this game and because I am a cat and not a twoleg,I don't have to cover my webcam. Well....I did cover it in case. But here's what the supposed to be Angela said to me! I said soon to her WHO ARE YOU?!?! And she put,My name is Angela. But soon I said again WHO ARE YOU!?!? She put Kidnapper. And I put WHY and she put I don't know. And she once asked my age and name though. This is scary but I didn't put the word to make your can flash because I think it may put viruses on your moble devise.I also saw a trace of a man in its HIS eyes. (The following is not yelling....Don't call it a call for attention.) REMEMBER TO TAKE YOUR TIME ON HIM! AT FIRST ANGELA WILL NOT ADMIT TO BEING A STALKER BUT SOON HE GETS QUARKY. Be an explorer and get this app,cover your can and webcam and delete that app right after the risky chat. And also he knows wtf,lol,lolz,and stfu so !BOOM!<br />  fresh...........	1
186151	ok so first...I thought that Fnaf 4 was coming out on Hallowenn but then I go to games and I see this game so i'm like WTF I can see that Scott released another game early again...I love the game but I can't get past the first night cuz of the bug.. it crashes a lot and I can't even play it for 10 mins without it crashing so PLZ FIX DIS BUG! Love this series btw!! Bye	5
186482	then I went to download it again but as I was doing so it. says open when I already deleted it<br />WTF PLS I NEED HELP ITS MY FAVORITE GAME AND KINDLE IS ONLY THING I HAVE PLS HELP	3
186893	I used to love this notepad, then it went online. Not happy that I now must have an online account to look at my notes. I just want to remember something quick and look back later, I don't want another freaking online account, WTF.	1
187066	All I want to do is print from my Kindle FIRE to my new Brother laser printer.  It doesn't seem like it should be hard, since I was told at &#34;Best Big Electronics & Gear&#34;; (you know of whom I speak) that said printer was &#34;definitely compatible, no problem&#34;.  Well, apparently not, since Brother lists this (utterly USELESS and probably abandoned & unsupported) app as the only way to get files from Kindle to the $200+ printer I just bought.<br /><br />First, I had to get the app. Fine. Ignored all the 1-star reviews because &#34;that won't happen to ME&#34;.  Uh huh.  You've all thought that at some point, don't tell me you haven't.<br /><br />Then, I had to &#34;create an account&#34;; this involved providing my email address and then creating a &#34;Teamplace&#34; account.  Not that cool, but whatever.  I have a separate email address just for this sort of thing.<br /><br />Went through the tutorial, which is NOT a tutorial, but a series of four pages that brag on the suddenly amazingly NEW technology of platform-independent file sharing that they apparently invented.  (I guess they never heard of PDF document, Google drive, or any of the other tech that the rest of us have been using for years.)<br /><br />Okay, so I chose a file from the downloads folder on my Fire HDX 4th gen (not ancient tech, here, folks, it should work).  The Teamplace app shows a little icon and asks me how I would like to preview the file, offering me a dropdown menu listing OTHER APPS (ES File Explorer, or Kindle) - hello?  Why do I need to preview the file at all, and if I DO need to preview it, why does not the Teamplace app ITSELF allow for previewing?  No, it needs to call in apps that actually HAVE functionality.<br /><br />So I try the &#34;print&#34; function, which is buried in a little unlabeled menu near the typical &#34;share&#34; icon.  In fact, it's the last option on that menu.  Why?  Because it doesn't work!  Clicking &#34;print&#34; links to the Amazon APP STORE!!  WTF?!  (Excuse my language.)<br /><br />So I try &#34;creating a MyPlace&#34;, moving the document, and THEN printing it.  Again, I am linked to the main page of the AMAZON APP STORE!  What does that even MEAN?!  &#34;Go ahead, treat yourself to the FAOTD&#34;?  &#34;We have no idea what to do, but maybe you can find an app that actually works here in the App Store&#34;?  What does that mean?!<br /><br />Not to mention the fact that the Teamplace &#34;app&#34; (can you even call something an app if it doesn't actually have any functionality?  Or is it more like, oh, I don't know...really boring television?) is completely, utterly, unbearably slow to do anything whatsoever (whatever it DOES do...or pretend it's doing, more like, is very very very slow).<br /><br />So, wow, this little experiment took over an hour, accomplished nothing, save getting me extremely mad at<br /><br />1.  &#34;Teamplace&#34; for being a SHAM app that actually does NOTHING;<br /><br />2. Amazon for not letting people easily print their flippin' documents directly over WIFI (hello, Amazon, are you LISTENING?!  You DO know that people like to PRINT DOCUMENTS once in a while and it doesn't mean they are going to pirate your Kindle books, right?) and<br /><br />3.  Brother, for PRETENDING that their bloody laser printers are all completely WIFI compat with every tablet & handheld device known to man, and then when you actually BUY the product, THAT'S when they tell you that it's ACTUALLY every tablet & handheld device known to man EXCEPT KINDLE FIRE, for which you have to use TEAMPLACE, and you're back to square one, catch-22 in hand, see point #1 above.<br /><br />And you'll notice that my other reviews are usually not so full of profanity, so you can see how @$!# angry this debacle has made me.  You spend $400 on a tablet and $200+ on a laser printer, and I don't think it's unreasonable to think that in 2015 you OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PRINT THINGS FROM YOUR TABLET OVER YOUR WI-FI CONNECTION*EASILY* FOR PITY'S SAKE!<br /><br />I have been using computers since the early 1980s, when things were MUCH LESS &#34;user-centric&#34;; you had to set DIP SWITCHES and know DOS commands, and it was NOT THIS HARD to print a @$#! DOCUMENT!<br /><br />Posted July 2015.ric&#34;; you had to set DIP SWITCHES and know DOS commands, and it was NOT THIS HARD to print a @$#! DOCUMENT!  Posted July 2015.	1
190906	I could've given this game a 5/5 if it weren't for one little thing that blew it. Whenever I click on a stage to play it, it locks into the &amp;#34;pressed&amp;#34; animation until I press it again. Not a big deal until the game introduces the friend mechanic which sends out a helpful AI for a short time in the stage. So now, when I double-click the stage to access it, I'm greeted with the friend-select screen. I press &amp;#34;select&amp;#34;, and the exits said screen bringing me to the stage select. What? I didn't hit &amp;#34;x&amp;#34;, so why did that happen? Then I press the stage I want to play ONCE, press the second time to where I know the select button would be on the friend-select screen. Once it comes up, I press it at the exact same place again and it still exits. WTF?! After I continuously mash my fingers on the screen enough to allow me to access the stage and play, I could only think of how much trouble that took me just for that one simple action to take place and how many more times I would have to do that procedure again.<br /><br />The same double-click BS occurs too on the other menus. I would say that this may be due to a certain bug that ruined the experience for me. Unless the developers care to find and fix this bug, this game is as good as a dust-collector where the dust is the many minutes I spend on different and probably better-functioning games.	3
193507	I love playing it, I wish their was a thing so that your friends can join on a team also I been having problems with the gAme recently before I updated it last like Ill go into the game and the iPhone address is blank I press play and it doesn't go into a match I tried exiting out of it but idk what to do ill try powering the kindle off and turning back on and see if that's the problem but other then that problem I just been having it's very fun really ADDICTING sometimes ill yell at my team mates for not getting out of my way touching my person so that it pushes me back a little then I get screwed when I am trying to flee bitches anyways I get very angry ill be yelling wtf where is my team help me come on where are you help me out team	4

199031	It's so scary!!!why is this recommended for all ages?WTF!!!<br />üò°	3
199256	I haven't had this app for my Kindle Fire for long. It was great. I could check my balance and pay my bills. Today I tried to use the app and the above message popped up. I thought it was a mistake. I removed it from my Kindle and download again. SAME MESSAGE! WTF??!!! I hate when they change things without warning.	1
200740	The game won't let me sign in and it looked really cool too WTF gameloft.	2
202189	The new app have access it your camera on your phone, and it monitors your sms! Wtf and has access to you contacts this is rediculous. No more free America	1
202582	WTF WTF  WTF WTF WTF WTF	1
206140	I don't understand why I could download this app through the play store but when I try through Amazon it's not compatible with my device!? Wtf?!? Makes no sense what so ever! Glad I didn't actually pay for the app and used a credit they gave me otherwise I'd be extremely pissed but you guys should really explain this and figure it out because that makes no sense at all!!!	1
206340	I just updated and lost half my donuts. WTF!<br />Soo glitchy	1
211253	This game was fun for a little while when I first got it, but now I can't even open the app even after I uninstalled it and reinstalled it...... uuuuuuuuuummmmm, WTF!!!	1
220074	You gotta be kidding me - people give this five stars?  Still 3 commercials each break (and many breaks) just shorter ones - BUT now they are all the same.  Every break.  Every episode.  The CIA could learn from this as a mind torture device.  - every 6 minutes bad annoying commercials (I will never go to McDonalds again after the onslaught of wtf Minion collaboration).  And you pay $6.99 for the privilege.  Yes - you pay to see the same annoying ads over and over.<br />Do yourself a favor and pay for a TiVO box so you can fast forward through them all.  It's worth it.	1
222161	I got mine as a birthday present, out of the blue - as in, they all thought it was really exciting, and I was thinking wtf is this?  It's a combination of features that are available on any of my other devices (phone, laptop, work computer, etc), so what's the big deal?  This thing may be portable but it won't fit in any pocket or normal handbag, so it's likely that this will be restricted to just one location and just one room so, again, what's the biggie?<br /><br />Then I started using it and realized that I now have totally hands-free, 24-hour voice control over some of the things I might have going on around me in my favorite place to multi-task, such as streaming music while I cook. It will play any track or album I've ever bought from Amazon, stream Pandora etc. or any radio show including BBC Radio 4 (and I live in the USA !!!), or any podcast, I can tell it to skip a track, increase/decrease the volume, pause/resume, stop. If the phone rings, I can kill the music (and/or up the lighting), just by asking while I am reaching for the phone ....<br /><br />The web search feature is like having a really smart person in the room who only speaks when you say her name and ask her a question. It's not Google, but it integrates the concept of googling questions raised during any conversation that takes place in our kitchen in a surprisingly conversational way.<br /><br />The super, super easy thing about this system: anytime that it's plugged in, you don't need a remote, don't need to find your phone ..... you just need to say the &#34;wake word = her name, Alexa&#34; and you are good to go.  [If you're not in voice range or if you want to change options,etc, you can control it via the app on your phone/tablet/whatever.]<br /><br />Did I mention that anyone in range can control it by voice command? This thing seems well adapted to family life in that they seem to have focussed on environmental contol that can influenced by everyone who is directly experiencing it.<br/><br />Early days yet, but this thing is already very good and is going to get better and better ......	5
223486	The game itself isn't the worst, but not the best by any means! I'd give it 3 stars, but the fake reviews they gave and the permissions caused me to bring it down to 1 star. There was one review which went to far....(June 23, 2015 by Zenk Rodney<br />It is A very interesting APP, children like to play, can also help the development of intelligence of children at some degree) WTF, how is this developing intelligence in children??? It sure isn't helping Zenk with his English!	1
225170	Ok let me get this straight. Do not get this app. I love country music and I thought that I would try this app... no. All country songs are either covers or remixes. Like Wtf. Really? Do not get this app.	1
230214	This apps sucks d. It wouldn't even open. It said u couldn't open it at two devices at a time. Like wtf bro. Deserves zero stars. Don't waste ur time om this bullcrap.	1
237913	Come on its a good game but number1 it's a rip off 2 the kids are at a bar WTF 3glitchy	2
242812	I love the History Channel, I really do, but what is with all of the permissions?! Control my WiFi? Required to use my camera? WTF!! Uninstalled, you bunch of domineering perverts!	1
245709	I love A&amp;E and a lot of their shows, but what is with all of the permissions?! Control my WiFi? Required to use my camera? WTF!! Uninstalled, you bunch of domineering perverts!	1

259908	Hold up hold up hold up that three time this game got me thinking that I am about to have some mid evil fun  then I'm all happy and junk and it loading and unloading when it finally was done I click a level and it went to home like wtf who does that that got me really mad so I am thinking maybe just maybe it just my tablet nope not at all  it the #@$_(=#  game damit	1
263081	Downloaded and tried playing only to be presented with Audiobook Download screen that wants to take me to a website.<br />WTF???<br />I am not interested in an Audiobook and have no intention of going anywhere on the web before playing the game	1
263697	It's not normally my kind of game, but I found the story enjoyable. I would definitely give it more stars if it weren't for those few but super huge flaws: - Once you've picked an option, it's impossible to go back. I like to be able to go back and forth to explore options, as far as I found it is not possible in this game without restarting all over... Not quite modern for a game about super high tech robots! Really, WTF were the dev thinking? I can't possibly rate higher than 1 star just because of this. - You can't save your story, so whenever you restart to make a new one, you lose all your previous story :/ - It asks for strange permissions that don't really seems necessary. Not really a big deal though, it works fine offline.	1
263978	Why isn't this available on my Nexus Player?!  It's available on Android TV's from Sony, and it works on Fire TV which is based off Android..but Amazon refuses to make it available to the Nexus Player.  WTF Amazon!?  I pay $100 a year for Prime and I can't even watch your videos on my device?!	1
274520	So I've had this app for a year until my husband and I 3weeks ago<br />we no longer had access to the WiFi. So I removed from device.<br />Last night on our cell phone we got a text from ME. Yes, ME. My profile picture, nickname,and number from TEXTME. WTF???<br />The message read, Who is this? Hmmmm,,,,,, so we text back who we were and asked why do you have my number. He said his name was David and just got this app and was going through the list of contacts it came with. We called him and told him what was going on. Needless to say all 3 of us were boggled. So David is going to delete my profile and make his. Then he is going to text again to see if it shows up as ME.<br />  I would of recommended this app but I suggest you DON'T GET THIS APP!!! To be continued.......	1
278545	I got the app downloaded from amazon.de in Germany.. i played that game since Dez. 2014 so nearly 8 Month..  NOW I CANT UPDATE  because the app is not availible nomore at amazon.de  only at amazon.com or amazon.co.uk  and so i dont get into the game  bacause i need to update  but thats not possible..  I wrote Ember-Entertainment  and still got no answer  !!  after a few days of sending mails..  the reason why  is not really clear  but that is really  a big bunch of s***  I spend a lot of time and money  .. and now  i got nothing!!  WTF !!!!!	1
279152	I've had to start over 3xs because for some reason when game updates I lose all my stuff n have to start over.there should b a way to regain access to this game with logging on BUT ITS NOT!!! they want u to give the codes n support ids wtf old friends names n.New.ones wth who writes down the names of these things Smh this game SUCKS!!!!	1
281864	Why is everything in Spanish wtf? Deleting! All this trouble for what an app store I already have what is the purpose. So amazon can get money?	1
283088	There is no reason I can think of that amazon should need to have access to the flashlight on my phone!!! Seriously?! WTF amazon?!	1
284817	Worked fine for the first week, then stopped working.  IDK WTF happened?!?!?!?	3
285667	With the latest update to the app all I have to say is WTF was someone thinking?!?!?!<br /><br />What is the point of having the parental controls for keeping my kid from being able to buy things when you change the app so now my kid is given a website, that doesn't have the parental restrictions on it, where they can just wander and go OOOOOOOO that looks interesting to watch and push the button to make it play, buying it, which I then am stuck with said purchase no matter what it is because it is a digital purchase and not allowed to be refunded.  The whole point of this app on my kids tablet was so when we are driving he could be entertained with a show and now he can't do that because I'm not Mommy Warbucks loaded with cash to buy every blasted thing available from Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />This only seems to apply to people using android I have noticed too because my iPad, which won't play things cuz it constantly gives me the following error &#34;Playback error Your device's internet connection is currently using an http proxy which prevents you from playing your video.  From your device's homescreen, tap settings, and select 'Wi-Fi'.  View details for your Wi-Fi network and set 'HTTP Proxy' to 'Off'.  My HTTP Proxy IS set to Off but whatever.  I can't let my son play on my iPad anyways on trips because on this device he requires supervision because if he has internet to watch things, assuming it would let him watch things, he also has internet to access plenty of other apps he shouldn't be accessing and the last thing I need is to find out all my schoolwork has been deleted from cloud storage permanently and I have to redo any work.<br /><br />One of the only reasons I became a Prime member was for things like this to keep my kid entertained and now I can't use it so why should I keep the membership once it comes due again???	1
292384	I looked up, it was 12:45. After what felt like 15 minutes, it was 3AM. WTF? This game is might addicting, and right now I'm on level 100.<br /><br />Graphics are gorgeous and game play is smooth, but as many other reviewers have mentioned, text is insanely small. I thought maybe it had to do with the resolution on my 10&amp;#34; tablet, but after reading the reviews, it's clearly not only me. Regardless, this game is well worth the money, and unlike Candy Crush, no need to wait to recharge!	5
298712	Can't even get a widget for this! WTF?	2
300160	I can't get in to it at all I can do anything not even delete it. WTF DID U PPL DO WITH THE CRAPPY UPDATE?!?!?!?!?	1
301177	It says failed to install!!! WTF!!!!	1
308208	OK, well, I give it two stars rather than one because, at least, it works. If it didn't work, it would be one. Two Stars (which is really, really terrible for a multi-billion dollar tech company) is because of the reason all the others have cited. Its not.actually.an.app. I mean, WTF? It makes me download or use the lame Amazon Appstore to &#34;download&#34; the &#34;app&#34; and then voila, there is no &#34;app&#34; installed on my device. The way I watch instant video content is to go into my browser (or the Amazon app) and choose something, and then say, &#34;watch&#34; and the &#34;app&#34; magically allows me to do so. Lame. Lame. Lame.	2

334808	I like it but I don't like how there is dating going on I mean wtf stupid people can't date on a game	5
335634	Umm well this game is amazing. Thank you pixelberry studios. However you do not deserve capitol letters on your title. High School Story is umm questionable, it glitches. I had gotten a homecoming guy, I go to customize him, but every stupid time it closes me out of the game. Cons of High School Story......<br /><br /> It glitches!!!<br /><br />I love this game. Hollywood U is ok, but the reason I told you the &amp;#34;High School Story Problem&amp;#34; was because  pixelberry made BOTH of these games. I know what your thinking your thinking wtf is this person's problem? Well I'm wondering if this game will glitch too............. üòíüòíüòíüòíüôÖüôÖüôÖüôâüôâüôâüôâüôÄüôÄüôÄüôÄüåå	5
338131	I bought this game on March 21st for my daughter. We bought it for her kindle. She played it for several months, then we had to reset her kindle and it disappeared. Now it says I can't download it because it's only for android. It let me pay for it, and it let her play it on her kindle for months......If I paid for it I should be able to play it! WTF?	1
341315	This.is.awesome.No.lie.I.guarantee this so get it or ELSE. I FREAKIN LOVE THIS. I think I'm high &deg;^&deg; LOL WTF IS WRONG WITH ME!?!?	5
343608	Center GM why did you say this was free when u have to pay 0.99&cent; to access it. Just make the game 0.99&cent; right off the bat! Also (according to other reveiws) u made the other starts cost money as well. WTF!!!! If u want money f*cking make the the game a one time purchase WHEN U PURCHASE THE APP!! OKAY!!!!!!	1
345285	When I got the app I was hella excited about it and it was cute and fun. But after about a week of having it, I couldn't get the app to load. It just showed a black screen. I tried shutting down my kindle, closing the app, downloading it. I even checked to see if I needed to be updated. This sucks!!! The game itself is fantastic and addicting, but I would really appreciate it if you would make and effort to find out wtf is wrong with it.	2
348459	I noticed this app the other day. So I deleted it. I don't care a thing about TWP. I was trying to download a game a couple days later and was so aggravated that it was taking so long. Oh hey there TWP, go ahead and download yourself again. After failed numerous attempts to trick it into stopping (wifi off/restart/etc) I decided to let it finish so I could delete it again. Which I did. I get on my kindle today and there it is again! This is starting to get ridiculous. After I deleted it AGAIN, I deleted it from my cloud. I started downloading a game and went to check the progress and oh! There it is. AGAIN! After I deleted it from my cloud! All I have to say is WTF Amazon? I don't care who owns what, if I DELETE something off MY Kindle and MY cloud account, I expect it to stay deleted. Period! I have loved my Kindle Fire since I got it two years ago, but if I see this stupid app on my Kindle one more time I'm selling this piece of trash and buying an iPad.	1
353715	i think this is really bad dont get this it s stupid kindle needs more better apps wtf  this is just s***	1
354371	Why isn't this just a Web service? The lame and unnecessary app won't work on my Samsung tablet. Wtf. Terrible.  I can't even review the service because the stupid app is actually a barrier preventing its use.	1
354525	Love the game, but can't get the new update to install and can't play unless I update. Wtf!	2
355868	When I first looked at the titles, I was like WTF?  You won't find any A-list blockbusters on here...hell, you won't find any B-list stuff either.  I mean these are some REALLY obscure titles!  Like others have said, you'll find things on here that can't be found anywhere else.  Probably because nobody wants to watch this stuff.  If you've heard of a particular title for a movie, you won't find it here.  Everything on here is completely unheard of.  But there is a s*** ton of content!!  I'm talking hundreds and hundreds of movies, TV shows, and a lot of that foreign anime cartoon crap.  Most of the movies are like old school horror flicks, old kung fu movies, and just really weird, off the wall stuff.  Just looking through all the titles is entertaining in itself!  It takes a while to hunt through all the titles to find something worth watching, but there are some rare gems in here if you look around enough.  It's the kind of stuff that you might want to watch on a boring Sunday afternoon when you have nothing better to do.  But the best thing about this is that it really is a great running app!  I'm on a Kindle Fire and have no problems with it running at all.  The menus are easy to navigate, it's fast and doesn't buffer endlessly, great picture quality, not too many ads, and just overall a really clean running app.  It reminds me a lot of Crackle, but this actually runs and plays better with less ads.  And it has WAY more stuff to watch than Crackle.  All in all, I love this app!  I wanted to give it five stars because it is such a good app, but I had to ding them one star just because there isn't enough recent and decent material.  I hope this review helps, give me a thumbs up if it does!  :-)	4
364843	Amazon Fire needs to upgrade their Appstore, I can't find the Second Rebuild or the Third Rebuild WTF. Come on now... more than half the games threw Amazon blow, they all suck. I was surprised to find this old... but popular game in thier Appstore. Up your game Amazon put better apps and games on your Devices or expect to lose buyers and Followers of your products.	5
371171	I look forward to my time , that I send o. BuzzFeed. Whether it's an, awww, to a, ewww...no. Or, LOVE IT, vice a, WTF, smh.<br />Love me some Buzzfeed! üòÅ	5

389697	That's all I can say bc it won't work enough to do more. Seriously, wtf?	1
393719	Sugarsync is SHADY! After two years with Sugarsync, I decided to switch to a personal NAS drive to save cash in the long term and gain functionality, so I tried to cancel the service. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CANCEL. I have been trying for over a week to call their ‚Äúcancellation department‚Äù phone number (the ONLY way to cancel, and only open for 4 hours a day) and the only thing I ever get on the line is hold music. I have waited as long as 30 minutes at a time and never has a human picked up. Worse than that, there is no way to leave a message, no telephone support number or other means of cancelling my service. Seems like the ‚Äúcancellation department‚Äù is just an unmanned phone line. I am considering calling VISA and telling them that the repeated charges are fraudulent because this company simply does not allow users to cancel paid accounts. WTF?? Why does an INTERNET STORAGE company with ONLINE payment processing and account upgrades NOT allow ONLINE account cancellation? Because they are SCAMMERS.	1
394414	love it but cant use on my verizon S4G? WTF? soo mifftied! allI wantedwas that Predator countdown Haha boom.	5

And it takes along time to get some coins and everything is sooo pricy. Lower prices, Let us get energy faster. And I will love this game forever (review by my daughter)	4
402334	Dont listen to thoes 5 star reviews they are fake. this game plays like a fat guy trying to walk up stairs. walking is incredibly slow and bullets take too long to kill anyone. you have no melee button so if you run out of ammo you are screwed. the graphocs are so low resolution that it hurts my eyes. the textures are just the block textures from minecraft. there are also too mnay refrences to sky does minecraft, like wtf dude can I just play with out the word &amp;#34;BUDDER&amp;#34; being screamed out every 5 seconds. dont play this game its not worth the 0.00 I spent on this game.	1
404756	This app SUCKS!!!!!!!!!I tried to install the new Wells Fargo app for android or tablet this is my 5th time trying to install this app and it won't install.

This game is amazing, but it's not free and its not a full game it's just a trial. At least ftp games are 100% free... you can just get a little extra s*** if you got some cash, wtf is wrong with that. They have to make money somehow you damn noobs. At least they don't label it as free, charge you for it once you start to enjoy it and then sell you add ons and in game s*** like this game.

THIS GAME SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THE APP STORE!!! I'M SORRY FOR PPL WHO THINK MY COMMENT IS HARSH AND OFFENSIVE.... BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. So yea this is a time waster	1
473482	I love it, it has better detail and movement compared to the (Pocket-Edition Minecraft) Since my PS4 busted I had to do something on my tablet until I get my Xbox, only 2 problems one there's no Multiplayer and it somehow deleted itself from my device and cloud and I had to F**king re-download it and pay for it again. Then when I re-downloaded it, it says it had a problem downloading due to Wi-Fi connection or something, yet I have the best connection and one of the best Wi-Fi networks out there so wtf???? And when I contacted customer service they said they will do something about it in so many day and recharge me  afterwards... wtf Amazon	5
476352	I think Amazon is the best thing since slice bread so it is an utter disappointment that this app fails in epic proportions.  I have contacted Amazon tech support and there isn't a permanent solution.  Uninstaller and reinstall works for a little while then you get the message prime instant videos are not available for this device at the time.  WTF.  FIX IT AMAZON.	1
478738	I'm like omg wtf in my brain because I'm in the 7th grade and a girl! And I still play this. I'm not even a nerd or tomboy! GET THIS GAME!!	5
481738	No fun in this at all. I gave it a fair shot, bought tokens twice, nine bucks worth and it lasted a matter of minutes. There are far better slots where i can play for an hour or more on the given bonus. This was not a house of fun but a house of wtf.	1
484375	Amazon says I bought this, and I have no memory of that.  Must not be too great since I don't know WTF it is.  Sounds like it might be a convenient way to rip off copyrighted videos but I'm not sure.	1
488967	I haven't even been able to play the game because every time I open it it says it can't connect to the internet. I can't do ANYTHING!!!üòàüòàüò°üòàüòà I can't experience the game or anything because of this. WTF Amazonüò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨	1
492962	Downloaded, but then deleted it. If I'd noticed that one of the permissions is to read contact data, I wouldn't have &#34;bought&#34; it in the first place..  WTF?  Why does a screen dimmer need to read users' contact data?  Totally unacceptable.	1
494774	Since this is impossible to install on my Galaxy S it gets 0 stars. The install screen on amazon app store even says I can get it instantly on my connected device, but there is no option to do so. I have the store app for android installed & followed the security<br />directions, but no go. WTF?	1
498558	It's way to hard like wtf stupid	1

499712	After hours of pulling my hair out and calling Amazon customer service to figure out why this APP does not work on my Android Kitkat 4.2 Tablet is beyond me. They obliviously think everyone is running brand new tablets that they bought yesterday. I plan on using mine for few years, what about you? My tablet is only 5 months old. I think it's ridiculous!!! I bet it works on the Kindle!!!!! Look at all the Google searches that come about this problem!!! 280,000 to be exact!!!! WTF Amazon?<br /><br />https://www.google.com/search?num=20&q=amazon+instant+video+doesn%27t+work+on+android+kitkat&spell=1&sa=X&ei=eqBqVeXiNZepyAS7kYLgBA&ved=0CBsQvwUoAA&biw=1360&bih=609	1
500109	Omg Wtf really? It says the app is free , but then they ask for $2.00<br />In order to proceed ! Don't even hit the download button, its a waste of time!!!üòàüòàüòà	1
503092	Hvnt. bought this even tho I soo want it and so do all my kids. gave a 2 star rating because IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY OF MY KINDLE FIRE HDs. My kids have second generations fire hds, I have third gen fire hd. none of my android phones can have it either. WTF AMAZON???  Makes no sense that a game made by Amazon game studios would not be available to electronics made by amazon!!! That is just dumb!  guess I'll go spend my $7 somewhere other than amazon, maybe Gamestop.<br />A smart move would be to make it available for kindle devices, dont you think Amazon Game Studios??!!	2
506917	The only way I can make this app work to watch prime video is by uninstalling the update and reinstalling the update. After not using prime video for a few hours or overnight the prime video disappears from the drop down menu. I then open the instant video app and it says my device isn't compatible after watching it for 2 hours earlier!! Then I have to go through the uninstall reinstall crap again and it will work until it decides to quit again! WTF! I already paid you crooks $99 upfront!	1
509372	Waste of time this game sucks wtf is wrong with this game it's so boring	1
515650	I need more games exactly like this, quality, game model, just more variety like this, but wtf is up with the wait on lives?  To teach us patience? To force us to take a breather when losing? Is it really only a marketing tool for in app purchases?	4
516650	It's now &#34;free&#34; once you click on the installed app to play it says you must pay $1.99 to have access WTF.	1
517380	I can play this game for a little bit at amax id say about 20 minutes and then the game just straight up crashes and then closes me out WTF please fix this issue rockstar. thank you.	4
520346	i had 3 freaking gigs on my phone free....and a whole 11.2 gigs on my sd...i deleted everything from my phones memory (pics, apps, etc) and it said i had 4.1 gb....and i tried installing this p.o.c. app only for it to say that there is insufficient space.....WTF!!! and whats worse after i tried this 2 more times...my space has been reduced to .90 gb........wtf!!! where is this invisible storage space thats being taken up????	1
522880	It's a dame puzzle wtf people rip off I thought it would be fun but nope	1
526342	I got this app and I tried to translate something from English to Japanese, and it says I need internet connection. I have internet, I tried to reboot my internet and when I got back, it still said I need internet. WTF? It deserves more stars. I hope this doesn't happen to you, my kindle is old.	1
534590	It makes you pay 2.00$ to play like wtf just rate 1 star btw don't even buy!!!!!üòàüò¨üò°üò†üòíüôÖüí©üí©üí©üí©üí©	1

543452	Ugh can't find any thing and wtf mixing purchase with free? it wouldn't hurt to rip off netflix set up just a lil &#62;&#60; claims to have all these titles but can never see em, for example try going to the kids section all the titles are from nickelodeon even though I know they have others...so agrivating....	2
546352	Any nickname I put, even fiebdjs39283 says the name is taken, wtf?<br /><br />I	1
548493	Been enjoying the game for a while when all of a sudden the license expired  wtf!  Sega I want my money back!!	1
551387	Camera is upside down crashes and only one gender wtfüòà	1

556854	can't register my fire...to always saying you error and keep tryin..wtf..I'm just about to throw this s*** up the wall	1
568634	My first device using Kindle for Android was AND STILL IS, my ancient and heavy Trio tablet, running Jelly Bean. Kindle still runs just fine there, as well as on my giant Samsung Galaxy 4 tablet 2014 edition. Kindle ran GREAT when I downloaded it onto my pocket-size Moto-G last week. (My Moto-G has no storage; only a SD card of 8GB.) Among other disabilaties, I have Low Vision and the Kindle app enables me to read ANY TEXT EASILY and TURN A PAGE WITH A SINGLE TAP, and all that WITH ONE HAND USING MY SMALL ANDROID. So, I am bummed out to have to uninstall it, but the stupid pre-crash-message keeps interrupting my video shooting, (and everything I do) asking if I want to close the Kindle app. Like, &amp;#34;Hello?&amp;#34; WTF? I haven't even used the app since last week! I'll miss it.	4
576570	Dude I knew it was fake from the beginning I just downloaded it so I could write this.  And wtf is Laura from tomb raider doing in the picture slides?!?! Dude really?!? That's low.  I'm a gamer and I don't recommend this game.  I'm ashamed to even call this a game.	1
576608	I was trying to watch the Bruce Jenner interview and the kindle insisted I download this app to do so...I searched for the show from the app and when I clicked on it, it took me back to the silk browser and insisted I download the app. Over and over again. I'm no idiot, but WTF? I removed the app from my kindle and watched it on my laptop instead.	1
580359	Want to install the app??? ABSOLUTELY THE STUPIDEST ANY COMANY CAN DO!!!!! OH MY GOD!!!!! WTF!?!?!?	1
581018	Another genuine POS.  I'm sorry, but the creator of this app must be the same person who wrote the other reviews. This thing is cumbersome, difficult to use to any significant degree, the settings are virtually useless, and makes access to your recordings difficult. Wtf!	1
582364	It is useless. One very clear and nice pic got just blurred. Other pic with not enough light got it rised on ALL of it, making parts of it shine too much... also upper half got some weird black stripes all over it. WTF?	1
586361	Sent me to chrome wtf!	1
587134	Great app. purchased ALL 11.  Now it wants me to purchase ALL 11AGAIN!!! WTF??? This has happened with 2 Mindifi apps I purchased. Give me what I've paid for OR give me back my $$$$$ ASAP.	5
588518	And yet another load of crap!!! Let's see now...I have wasted about an hour and a half trying app after app after app...not a one of them worked on my Kindle!! WTF man...do ANY of these apps even work on Kindles or is this all just some big joke to see who gets pissed off the most!!??? Cause if it is, I ain't laughing!!!!	1
591452	Code to unlock doesn't work. Second one they send doesn't either. Not enough digits. WTF?	1
607019	umm hi I'm trying to download music and videos and well I can't now so what's going on?? &gt;:( it says youtube was upgrading and I'm like wtf umm ok and I'm mad like bruh I'm like resetting and searching but it don't work somebody better fix this	2
607525	Yo I just updated this app and now it just says &quot;Not Responding Force Close&quot; was working fine before wtf...	3
609812	My first impressions was: Why does this app need so many frelling permissions to do what it offers?  But since it was selected App of the Day by Amazon I figured it was cool, and I allowed it to install.  My next impression is that it makes a bunch of neat sounds, but unless you sleep with the phone plugged in, it would suck the battery down.  I also felt having a screaming-bright digital clock while I was trying to sleep was a non-starter.  So the first complaint is it muted my Nexus 4's alarm to one ring then silence with the display flashing away... The second complaint is it locked up device with 60% battery and a dark display. I had to go online to learn how to reset my phone.  Interesting, but completely unwarranted for a pretty menial app. Last issue... It went away??? WTF? I didn't uninstall it, it's just gone!  Not that I miss it.  My advice: they did some cool things, but they seemed to miss the big picture of an app that's supposed to be 'restful and calming'. Instead they created a 'thing' that was stressful & aggravating.  tl;dr = Don't bother Downloading.	2
615004	worst decision ever.. i was trying to find a quick easy gift card.. this is not it...<br /><br />first... i couldve dealt with a monthly fee but theres also a reload fee??<br /><br />second.. You have to give way too much private info.. if im going to do that.. why not open a bank account?? oh wait.. from the sound of it.. that it exactly what they do.. they take down all your info.. then issue you a different card?? wtf??<br /><br />just.. no.. dont do it..	1
615610	ggghtttgfgffg that u send ballons and kill wtf so how does that work huh I mean like im still typing so I can finish the review	1
628181	Installed it on my phone and it worked ok. Pretty slow and you have to go through a series of selections each time you re start. Went to see if there were any new movies just now and was informed that it's not available for this device. Wtf? It worked just fine until today...	2
633577	I first tried Viewster about a year ago, It was horrible  every time a commercial played Vioewster would restart the movie. That ment you got to watch the same first 10 to 15 min of the movie and a lot of commercials. I uninstalled it, I believe in second chances and so I decided to give Viewster a second look. These guys have really worked on this network. The app works now, it has a quirk now when a commercial set 1 or 2  finishes Viewster returnes to the movie opening screens but just briefly like a remedial teacher, Viewster reminds you what you are watching thai is for 1 to 2 min or less then it jumps back to  where you where when the advert interrupted you viewing pleasure. NOW Pleasure is what you can expect. This network is likened to no other, here you will find  Movies, TV Shows, .Documentary,  Anami , But like nowhere else Titles like is This A Zombie a Filmmation  Japanami with English dubbing. rated a whopping 99.51 % fully deserved. But hold on because this story features a young high school boy who is murdered by a serial killer , then brought back to live by a beautiful necromancer but he is now a Zombie , not finshed yet she uses him as a servant to cook for her and when something bad comes a knocking,  He is changed into a really dolled up Drag Queen toting a chainsaw. Funnest damn cartoon series ever . Yes Viewster has things you will never see anywhere else. The audience is guided by detailed revues and ratings.on all of Viewsters Library filled with hidden GEMS.  I now spend more time connected to Viewster than  Hulu Plus, Netflix, or Amazon Prime  Most of the content on Viewster  You need Amazon Fire TV to get the best viewing experience out of Viewster, but once you start using their revue + ratings to browse their  vast and impressive library free. So go to Viewster tp  amuse, arouse, confuse, educate or wonder WTF. This Gem of a network will grow on you like a hairy mole.  I really love it. I end this review (  longest review I have ever written on anything)  Giving both praise and  koodos to the creators for you have hit the mark You have created  a real one of a kind network. I guarantied Viewster is unlike any network any where on this planet. I give it  5  stars Viewster tops my list.	5
638713	Well, I was watching pewdiepie play this  and it seemed fun when he played it.<br />Then I was curious if it was on the kindle<br />Because I got it after a month after I watch the video<br />But of course I downloaded it, And I loved the game SOOO much<br />I played it all the time then, after two month's I wanted to see more people who play talking Angela. So then I search up on YouTube<br />&quot;Talking Angela&quot; then I was so exited but wait A Minute.... WTF?!?! I wanted to see people Who play &quot;talking Angela&quot; so then I saw this vid it was called called &quot;TALKING ANGELA KILLER!&quot; The first bad talking Angela video I've ever seen it was By Diamond123<br />*Clicks It*<br />*Watches whole Video*<br />:0 and then I watched more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of those kind of talking Angela video's Until I was so obsessed with it it was going on for 5 months!!  But I'm not obsessed with those Video's anymore but that's the story but that is not all<br /><br />I got bored with the bad talking Angela video's<br />So then I move on with the killer toys stuff WICH WAS WAY SCARRIER so whatever bye!	3
638999	I cant see other peoples pictures unless I add them to contacts. I cant send pictures in my group only per person on my contacts. I can recive pictures in a group from others. Half the time I lose connection for a while and then get spammed by the sound like crazy. Wtf please fix it.	1
649620	this app is awesome when it works (duuuh) but when I open it doesn't work WTF fix this DO NOT GET	2
650216	Garbage! Does NOT work on Amazon Kindle at all. AMAZON does not have latest app in their library. Need an Android phone to work. New SIRIUSXM APP is carp anyway. They really screwed it up. Does not work right on ANY device. Apple/Android/Kindle/Etc...  New app does not work with downloads at all. No OFFLINE ABILITY ANYMORE TO USE DOWNLOADS!!!! MUST BE ONLINE OR CONNECTED TO 3 or 4G TO USE YOUR DOWNLOADS!!!! WTF!?  Siriusxm obviously have NO IDEA WHAT A DOWNLOAD IS USED FOR!! So you can listen at your own convenience!!! What a joke. I will be dumping SIRIUSXM at the earliest possibility! What a joke of a company. I feel like I am being ripped off and will call them to get a full refund. I HATE THIS COMPANY!! They have just STOLEN MY MONEY FOR A YEAR!  I FEEL LIKE A REAL JER# FOR SIGNING UP FOR ONE YEAR PREPAID FOR THIS APP!! H STERN BETTER LEAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN 2016! HERE IS ONE FAN WHO WILL NOT STICK WITH THIS SH##TYCOMPANY. I WILL JUST GET IT ON YOUTUBE. GO TO HE#L SIRIUSXM!	1
651401	Well guys I'm a doodle club player I love it. Then one morning without no warning I logged on and there was a new update. I was just like WTF! Thanks for listening	1
652633	It's all right I guess but it's really friggin weird. Wtf is the purpose of this game? Ijdk. It has stupid music, bad graphics, and not to mention it makes fun of all the obese people in the world. If you are creep/stalker and go watch people in the gym work out, this game will be the greatest addition to your life. If not, well just don't get it and your life will be the same as it was.<br />Yours Truly,<br />The App Critic	1
655013	Eww this kind of (fashion) is terrible a copy of frozen and I HATE frozen<br />Wtf most people don't even like Frozen and<br />Seriously? It's called (coco) and you have to almost unlock EVERYTHING ....AWFUL! This fashion is ***** I'm just 7 really.	1
657125	Loved this game when I downloaded it. Great game play and advancement opportunitys. It wasn't until the &quot;update crash&quot; that said I couldn't play without updating but alas could not find the place to do so not in app store or on amazon. With frustration I just went ahead and uninstalled it to cut my losses...until a month later I missed this great game and decided id download it again and start from the beginning untill it update crashed me out of it again...what did I find when I did? alas my previous saved game and 5 township cash for updating. wtf? I shouldn't have to uninstall a game to update it that makes no sense because in actuality it should have reset when it was uninstalled and redownloaded a month later.	3
663982	i love how when you hit the cars you go splay even the train makes the noise like WTF! seriously this is the most popular game i have ever saw	5
665362	It never downloaded like wtf it kept saying installation failed kindle fire hd users beware	1

671746	Ok this is a great game, but wtf!!! I just bought this game 3 days ago, and now it's free!!! Come on guys, that's just messed up. But like I said great game	5
671791	I bought this and have used it for months. Today it started telling me I can fling pictures at it all I want but it will only play 1 minute of movies until I pay for it. I tried everything I could think of. Nothing worked. I decided to just go ahead and pay for it again. Nope. Tells me I already paid for it. WTF?	1
685789	It's minecraft. Wtf. I don't see the point in having an option to write reviews.	5
686442	This game is fun if you really like cars and you have time to kill. You have to find the right difficulty setting for yourself. If you set the difficulty low you can read the model name in the picture; boring. If you set it at 100% you will be like WTF is that.	2
692093	Played the free version, which is the first 10 levels or so. I liked it enough to purchase the Premium for $4.99, ads said 100 single player levels etc. Played the next 10 levels..... keeps asking if I want to purchase premium again...... wtf?! I thought I just did that!!! Thanks for the rip-off.	1
692899	This sucks!!!! app will not open on my galaxy tab 4!!!!!! We have tried everyting...WTF....guess I'm not keeping prime, wanted for books and movies. I will stick with Netflix.	1
699005	READ BELOW<br /><br />ok. So I got this so I could make friends but all their was is People saying I'M HORNY and ASL???? I know it's stupid. Creepy perverts are on this. DON'T GET IT!!!! I was talking to a dude and he's like CAN I F*** YOU FOR FREE? COME OM BABY? I was like Wtf??? I'm only 12. Like I said DO.NOT.GET.IT. AND IF YOU DO I WILL NOT CARE BUT DON'T GET IT. I WARNED YOU!!!!!!!!	1
709786	Frogger? You young people say WTF is frogger? Google it. Same premise, entertaining, time waster.	4
711451	I found it hilarious that after forecasting 3 days of rain next week for parched Roseville CA, the following day's weather was predicted to be Dreary. WTF? After 3 days of rain we will be dancing in the streets. I guess we can't wait to get past that awful weather and return to our sweltering sunny days? How do you dress for dreary?	3
719951	The first app wouldn't even download and this one will send you to the app store for no reason. And that feeling lucky thing will say opening market then do nothing. WTF was it for in the first place?	1
721100	My master was playing this and when the Skelton died it said (omg you soo handsome) I said wtf soo I slap the kindle out of my master's hand and she just looked at me and whispered (thank you) she looked scard I just was confused	4
722278	This is a nice app and exactly what I was looking for.  Works flawlessly and doesn't have any annoying &#34;features&#34; enabled by default such as Randomly start playing (like 1 app I had), turn on when you enable bluetooth (WTF?), and start playing stuff when you plug in headphones.  No shuffle, no long pauses....it just..works!  Even when not in current memory, it holds your place perfectly.<br />I am not seeing any intrusive ads or other junk either.  Or begging.	5
733168	What is the purpose of this game. Match up similar symbols and make them disappear.  Win assistance icons. You have a certain number of moves to delete gummy icons. Sometime, make more than the number of points specified to win, and you lose. Try again, then, SUDDENLY, for no apparent reason, sometimes the game says I won, wipes the board clean, and awards all kinds of points and advances me to next level. WTF? I deleted this game as.......well. exactly what  it was designed to be, a waste of time.	1
736730	I love Amazon. Easiest online shopping experience yet. That being said, wtf is with these overly intrusive permissions. This is a shopping app with a few extras. Why do you need permission to edit my storage? My wifi? My gps? I'm being rhetorical. I'm aware of the reasoning, but it still makes me uncomfortable for Amazon to have such unrestricted access.	2
739700	Love the game. Beat it all the way. When is the new map coming out ? Also I fixed the dam and I still need to fuel up to get power. Like wtf lol	5
750243	youre forced to use facebook wtf!	1
751280	Right now im watching star trek the next generation and leiutant commander data has taken control of the enterprise im like data wtf over cant wait to see what happens next mind just got blown looks like datas maker is alive dundundun	5
753864	I have been trying to down load this viewer since last night with no success. I get to about 50 percent and then it says &amp;#34;down load paused&amp;#34;.  Tried this three times so far. Wtf Amazon?	1
756351	I brought my kindle fire on a trip specifically because United airlines said they provide free movies. I couldn't get it to work without downloading the app. So I paid 8&middot;99 for WiFi so I could download the app. And guess what? After screwing around with it for over an hour, the app doesn't even play movies. Wtf. I'm going to request my money back. This is stupid. :-/	1
757002	I was at level 139 had over 5 million coins and it restarted me at level 2 and set me back at bronze status. WTF?	1
757762	Could not find my Watch list, this should be right up front and easy to get to.<br /><br />Overall the novelty of Prime instant video is wearing off as it becomes more evident that Amazon is not interested in maintaining content (WTF happened to Dr who! I was in the middle of watching it and now its gone with no warning). I may not take it as a serious service for a while until amazon figures out how to handle licensing of content better.	1
758756	Like wtf on the first stage when i tap the chest stevn don't know what to do	1
772255	Really updated the Google play store app and it deleted that and forced me to get to get it from Amazon with new invasive permissions with no warning to get traffic to your site!! WTF?? I have amazon prime and spend money considering dropping it since Amazon wants to examine your entire life!!	1
778598	I JUST KEEP TRYING TO LISTEN TO MY FAVORITE SONGS BUT GUESS WTF HAPPENS?!?!? I WAIT FOREVER AND NOTHING HAPPENS IT KEEPS SAYING ITS LOADING!!!!!!!!!	2
779433	I had the app and it wanted to upgrade, now that it upgraded I get a message saying &amp;#34;its not available for my device&amp;#34; Really? Not available on a Samsung 5S. Wtf. Screw Amazon	1
780412	I can`t even sign up because  it does not tell you what you need to do with the user name wtf it is terrible do not get it its a waste of your time and mine just skip it ok everyone	1
780990	good game but stupid fricken messages every time I'm ar 3 what the hell man wtf is this about I mean seriously	2
781396	Has good graphics for the most part. Pretty un<br />Few things are NOT so cool. Hopefully the Glu dudes read these and usee some hints.<br />1: if you spend your &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; money to buy a weapon, when it is no longer useful we should be able to &amp;#34;sell&amp;#34; it so we can put the money towards buying another one. I know your in this to make money...but God forbid we could get back maybe 1/2 what we spent...?<br />2: if you do play this game be prepared to have to buy something with real money. I did tons of hunts saving up over $380000 in prize money thinking I'd use it to buy a great rifle that can be used in more &amp;#34;advance&amp;#34; hunts. I bought the rifle I needed. Well...if you Have to shoot more then one animal your screwed! Using your prize money doesn't get you semi-auto guns. So you shoot one animal and while the computer game cocks the rifle,very slowly by the way, the other animals are running, so You loose that hunt. You have to use real money to buy the semi-auto weapons. Pretty lame!!<br />I've even used the rifle I bought, and put everything you could on it, in a &amp;#34;higher&amp;#34; level hunt. Says hit the wolf in the brain...put scope on infrared and fired. Hit the f-ing thing in the brain and it didn't die!!!! WTF?!?!?!<br />Anyway, hope this helped?<br />Good luck hunting....keep your wallet near by	3
786756	The app asks me to root the device. Wtf root it for a mear game	1
787542	Game is fun, great graphics and gameplay, but I purchased no keys or ads and I still get ads!!!!!!!!! WTF, not cool at all!	3
792085	A little laggy on Kindle Fire HD 7, but lag doesn't matter too much in this game. I bought the Kindle Fire HD 7 because it was on the list of Blizzard certified tablets for Hearthstone, but when I was first installing Hearthstone the game told me it probably couldn't run on this device WTF?	5
797143	The first kindle I had was great and I discovered this game and let me tell u this game the BOMB.I was a pretty high level in the game I had every gun. BUT my kindle broke so I bought the HD and WTF it's incompatible fix amazon FIX IT	1
799552	I tried this app for my son. He wanted to have his own little pets to watch. Most of the things you need to do cost diamonds, which are nearly impossible to earn &amp; really expensive to buy. I tried to email a simple question and mentioned my son, and I was told kids under 13 shouldn't play. Totally irrelevant to my question about how the app forces you to pay to keep animals or ABANDON them if you left them alone for  a couple hours- you know, like if you GO TO BED! I explained my son sat with me to play. Again, auto-response tells me it's against tos to have a child under 13 engage in the app at all, even with a parent. Again, not relevant, but WTF? Now you're telling me I can't have my kid next to me? It's a joke. Not to mention, my kindle kept freezing once I got this, and the kindle is only 2 weeks old. I found mini pets, recommended against pet shop story, and it's amazing! You can easily earn diamonds, you get to feed the animals by choosing food, you adopt strays... it's so much better!!! AVOID THIS CRAP APP! Go with mini pets!	1
809951	Scott Cawthon wtf is wrong with you (in a good way), ur games are AWESOME but they scare the s*** out of me (almost literally), ur amazing at creating games that are just great, u think outside the box and do things that no one else will ever think about, ur games and ideas are legendary and I think we should put your name in the history books, I hope u keep making the FNAF series for a long time and just keep doing what ur good at, ur my favorite app developers of all time.      - your biggest fan, Alexx Ashby	5
812083	The game is great but the loading takes to long it makes me bored by looming at a screen that's has nothing and that shows one picture with boring music like wtf I rather play cookie clicker them this!	2
813250	I would have given this game 5 stars.Except, There's no way for me to even attempt to contact anyone when(all the sudden) it stopped allowing me to get my gifts. First of all, It only allows 3GIFTS to be given. Why?????!!!! Now, an ERROR occurs every time I try to collect. And after it dismisses my gifts, ONE AT A TIME, it allows me to play normally. How convenient that it only messes up when I'm trying to collect. And there's no way to complain. You should be allowed to receive as many gifts as your sent. wtf???	3
818096	Haven't got it to start yet - crashes immediately with an internal error then says I don't own the app... WTF? Maybe I'll write another review when it actually works...	1

832336	I downloaded this free app and as soon as I tried to install it a warning popped up from my security app. INVERT - BRAIN GAMES was potentially risky, gathering and sending my private data to an external source.<br /><br />I immediately removed it from my device and deleted from the Cloud, yet now every time a new app installs or updates - after I did a hard reboot - I get a notification that INVERT - BRAIN GAMES has installed (or another app has installed, when I happen notice that Invert is in the process of downloading. WTF?!) Why won't it just GO AWAY?  D*** parasite!<br /><br />Obviously, deleting it from my device and from the Cloud is not enough so I'm getting ready to log in to my Amazon.com account and deleting it from there too. I just hope this works and this piece of crap malware hasn't already done too much damage.<br /><br />My opinion? STAY AWAY! It may be harmless, but, IMO, it's behavior is too suspicious and it just isn't worth the potential risk.<br />ALSO, if you don't already have a good security app, get one. It can save you sooo much frustration, keep your device running well, and protect your private information.	1

Every time, I go to apps, click Amazon, clear the app data, open the app, login, download again, only to have not install. It just won't install. Wtf Rockstar!? Wtf Amazon!? I'm lucky I used Amazon promotional credits to buy this, but still... What a waste of time, effort, and credits.

952504	I have ordered from this app before with minimal problems, however I'm still giving this a one star review. The reason why is because of the alarming number of complaints and 1 star reviews I read on (most) of their items. First, I'll go into my experiences with this app. I downloaded it and immediately fell in love, it seemed like it had everything. All items appeared of great quality, and most never exceeding 20 bucks. My first purchase was a heavy black coat, with fur around the collar and inside. It seemed like it took over 2 weeks for them to &#34;process&#34; everything, once it was finally &#34;In transit&#34;, I checked the status everyday to see if it had been delivered. After a month and a half, still nothing. I wrote it off and contacted the app for a refund, which luckily was fairly easy to do. They refunded the money for the coat promptly, and I re-ordered it at a cheaper price from another link from the same app. It still took about a month, but I finally received my coat. The only similarity between the coat I received and the one I saw advertised was the fact that it was black. It had fur around the collar, but of a different color than advertised online, and it also didn't have the fur on the inside that was pictured. The coat that the chick wore in the photo was obviously much heavier than the one I received. But all in all, it was still cute and I still liked it, so I kept it. I also ordered a ring, that was delivered without issue and of good quality, no complaints there. About 3 months after I placed the order for the original jacket for which I was refunded, I got a weird package in the mail and when I opened it, it was the jacket from the unsuccessful first order I had placed that I had assumed went &#34;missing&#34;, it was exactly like the one I had re-ordered. I had originally ordered the first jacket in a size XL, realistically I wear a small, but because of the numerous reviews stating that the clothing runs small, I ordered the largest size. The second time around, I decided to order a Medium because it was the only size available. I tried on the XL coat just for comparison against my Medium coat. They fit exactly the same, in every way! Based off the hundreds of complaints I read about the clothing being too small, I'm beginning to believe that the size options may be just for appearances on the site. It's possible that they only make one size, and just send it out regardless, because a lot of customers stated that their clothing never came with size tags attached. I've learned from reading thousands of reviews for different items that whoever runs this app simply does not care about customer satisfaction or service. I've read reviews on everything from makeup, to clothes, to jewelry, and so fourth. There are always far more dissatisfied customers than there are happy ones. Hundreds of people claiming that the item they received was nothing like the item advertised in photos. An alarming number of people claiming that they never received the item AT ALL, but of course were charged for it, and even better is when they don't receive the item, and either can't get a response about a refund AT ALL, or they get a response, but the company is refusing a refund. The sizing, the sizing, the sizing...I knew from reading reviews to order clothing at a larger size, however I guess that that doesn't even matter. I distinctly remember reading a review from a girl who wore a size small, but ordered an XL just to be sure that it would fit, and when she received it she said that despite the much larger size, there was no possible way that she could ever wear this, as it looked like &#34;doll clothing&#34;. She said that when she contacted the app about the sizing issue, she received an email back (surprisingly), in broken English, saying, &#34;It's ok, this dress big stretch.&#34; The quality is frequently, if not always poor. Many customers claiming that buttons fell off of their clothes immediately while takingthem out of the packaging. In an alarming number of cases, sleeves/hoods were not even sewed onto the clothing, but thrown in the packaging regardless, leaving the purchaser to either sew them on themselves or trash it completely. In many cases there are rips/stains on the clothing when received (in one review a girl said that she was certain that there was a big blood stain on her nightie, EW!), and the clothing frequently comes inside out, in addition to the rips, leaving customers to believe that their purchases had been worn before. Jewelry is broken or coating chips off within hours. Items throughout the app, not just clothing, are damaged, broken, or completely different from what is pictured. It's been a boring past couple days for me, and I've just been sitting here reading reviews for items on this app, horrified. They will ship you an incorrect or damaged item, allowing you 10 days to return or exchange the item, but will ignore your emails until after the return period has passed, telling you that there's nothing they can do. With all the other shady business on this app, I can't help but think that this tactic is intentional. The worst part about the whole thing, is that despite all the unhappy customers and negative reviews, they fall on deaf ears. Whoever is in charge of this does absolutely nothing to improve quality, and makes no effort to help people with their complaints. You would think that they would look into all of this, but no. How something like this is allowed to happen is beyond me. Who looks into this? Is there anyone? Or is authority over this just as absent as the customer service for this app? I can only assume that anyone who gave this app 5 stars merely just downloaded it and checked it out, rather than coming from people who actually had a positive experience ordering anything. Not to mention that the more I think about it, the whole operation reeks of slave labor and sweat shops. I mean, it IS based in China. Sewing, stitching, etc. are frequently messed up, making me think that this whole thing is a whole lot shadier than we could ever imagine. Someone should definitely look into this. If you open a package for what should've been a dress, and ask yourself, &#34;Wtf? Did a 6 year old sew this?&#34; You might not be too far off. Just don't do it. Yeah, there's a few positive reviews there, but to me it's not worth spending money on something, HOPING you'll actually receive it, and that your order will be one of the very few that come as advertised. Shady business all around.<br /><br />**Update: I realize that this has been a really long read, but in my research I found out more info about this app and how it operates. As I was reading about this app online yesterday, I ran into a statement from a guy who claimed to have worked with these guys before. He said that a common tactic for these Asian wholesale distributors (like the ones on Wish), is to have a team look through Asian fashion magazines and adds. When they see a photo of something they believe will be appealing to buyers in other countries, they upload that photo onto their store site, advertising the item in the photo as the same one you're going to get. However, this team also has what is essentially a clothing database, if you will, filled with cheap, poorly made wholesale items. They look at the photo they snagged from the magazine or online, then they search to find the closest matching item (which most times isn't close at all) that they can get for wholesale prices. These sellers know in advance that they are deceiving people and don't care. Another thing I noticed after I posted the original review, was that there are also loads of people claiming that after they made a purchase, money started going missing from their accounts without explanation. When one customer finally got to the route of the problem, she was told that someone in one of these Asian countries had stolen her card info after she made a purchase using thisapp, and that they were in the process of trying to buy a plane ticket to Peru on her dollar.

1064785	I read it and ignored it...  You shouldn't.... Not worth the $0 I paid for it...<br /><br />I have been a loyal Slingbox customer for probably more than 5 years.  I bought a PRO-HD when it came out.  For something like 300 bucks!<br />Then the world started going mobile.  Slingbox eventually came out with an app for android... wait, I'm sorry... Not one, BUT TWO!!!  Now, buy itself, that wouldn't be a problem, right... except they charged $15 for EACH ONE!  WTF, right?  Was the streaming device worth $300?  Not really, but close... but to use it where I want to? Another $30?<br /><br />Anyway... Fast forward a few years.... And I've got a new office, and I don't want to pay the 40 a month just for cable in the office...<br />Then I saw they came out with this free one for Fire TV... So I figured I'd get a FireTV, and give it a shot.  It won't work with my PRO HD!  &#34;Unsupported&#34; the app says?  Why?!  Frustrated I checked the list of &#34;Supported&#34; devices... and went out and found a cheap M1... Plugged it in... and ... Garbage, the app is PURE GARBAGE.  Every time I try to change the channel, the app crashes... and has to restart!  It's ridiculous!<br />I want my money, and my time back.	1

1102401	1.) They remove a lot of things and they only add a few things.<br /><br />2.) They don't add any new skins since the Halloween update<br /><br />3.) They don't care about you're profile whenever you lose things; My clan and friends list was deleted!<br /><br />They also seem conceited.<br /><br />1.) Everyone knows that a game creator is really good at their own game, so since the creators played a lot, they got used to earning little amounts of coins (1 coin per battle wtf?), so they think everyone is going to get guns that are up to 300 coins! We used to earn about 5 coins minimum per battle. And survival mode used to be a  fun and easy way to get coins. You would earn at least 2 coins per wave!<br /><br />So in my opinion, they screwed this game up after the Halloween update.<br />( man, I'm gonna get so much hate for this)	3
1105972	Second time this diddly Squat game will not perform. First time I played it I brought up my character level to 99. After this achievement my skills disappeared wtf! Mp!

Well if you want join my guild search kilaz and go ahead and join	1
1107309	Necronomicon is a great game in theory,  but it possesses a couple of &amp;#34;wtf&amp;#34; features/moments that take some of the wind out of its proud,  ambitious sails (imho). The most serious one for me is the way modifier cards for the monsters--in particularthose cards that would otherwise hinder the player by boosting a monster's stats--almost never get played...at least the way I play. They can all simply be dumped to the graveyard and ignored.<br /><br />Granted, that creates an opportunity for some minor strategizing about whether and where in the discard piles to dump other cards I don't want on the board, but it just doesn't seem as if that sort of thing would have been the creators' intent. Hence, it smells to me very much like one huge, ugly bug, yet in several years of playing Necronomicon, I have never heard it mentioned , nor seen it addressed in a patch. This makes me feel as if I must be missing something obvious that might explain such a curious design choice. Yet quite a bit of thought expended on the matter by me has so far come up empty.<br /><br />Note that this feature has a huge effect upon gameplay, to the player's great advantage. Therefore, I wonder whether the monster modifiers were found, after publication, to make the monsters too strong and the game too hard to win, so they were neutered but kept in the game due to the large number of them--their absence would reduce the deck size by 2o% or so, which would itself alter gameplay somewhat and probably play havoc with the scoring system. So maybe that's the reason. Or not, because isn't this an electronic version of a board game that had been around for several years already when this was made? Hmmm. How curious...	4
1108849	Suddenly keeps saying I have lack of network connectivity even though I am connected to Verizon's network at all times! Closes as soon as I open it! Wtf it was great now doesn't even open.

1115276	So, played a tournament. Woke up to find I had won 250 rolls! Was so excited. Woke up the following morning to 25.<br />Where'd they all go you ask?<br />Apparently they were mistaken and handed out a bunch of free rolls to people by accident!!!!!? So they TOOK them back. WTF. That's just bad business, you , made the mistake, you pay for it. These people clearly don't care for their customers, I'm going to install a different free yahtzee and uninstall this based on principle. I didn't give it a 1 star because I liked the people I played against, and despite the customer service not actually caring or doing anything about my inquiry to their lack of morals, they still got back to me with 48 hours.	2
1115877	This game is an awesome game but has lots of glitches<br />1. I can't find my mate. I went to the heart and she is no where. I think she is stuck in a building.<br />2. Dogs fly off into the air. When I attack them, they somehow fly into the air and I don't know where they went. It was weird.<br />3. The dog catcher's car. As I was fighting the dog catcher, his car was slowly slipping into a wall and it disappeared. I was like wtf? And it was so weird!<br />4. The cars lead to nowhere. They don't go home but they just go around the same block.<br />5. You can't go into buildings. It sucks.<br />6. You fall through the earth. I fell into the ground and I was in water. There was an OCEAN under GROUND.<br />7. Humans are weird. They run and walk into buildings. They should be able to get in and out of buildings, houses, and cars to make it realistic.<br />8. Your packmates don't follow you and they don't go home. When I push the home button, my packmates run off. When I go home, they are not there! And I totally lost them!<br />Plz fix this problem. Thank you :-)	4

1131777	I have already deleted this game from both the kindle I use at work and the kindle I take on trips and at home. I am not opposed to paying a little once in a while when a deal is good. I purchased a block of 12 million coins on Superbowl Sunday right after the purchase say 10 minutes into using the coins the game started acting funny. So  rebooted my kindle- and bam- all the chips I purchased were gone. Tried to get a hold of them through e-mail. Heard nothing back. I actually continued to e-mail for the next 3 days but in the mean time was playing the tournaments and won one and I actually got myself back to having 8 million chips. It started acting wonky again just now so I rebooted the syste, again, they did it again all 8 million gone and now its acting like I am a new player even though it shows me being on level 102. WTF! I am done with this game and I consider this a lesson learned hope anyone reading this thinks 2xs before loading this game.	1
1133874	after installing, I can't see my people at all!!! Wtf, how do you let something heartbreaking like this slide through development	2
1138000	I bought this app many months ago, having at the time a hatred for typing on tablets in general. After I bought it I thought it was a little better than stock.  However, once Lollipop came out and Amazon's version of this app didn't get updated (STILL HASN'T WTF - IT'S IN GOOGLE PLAY!) and I was forced to switch back the the crappy stock keyboard (Same as apple's because iOS can't be customized) I realized how dependent I was on this app.  5 stars for the app itself, 1 star because it is currently disabled and unusable until Amazon gets its act together.  All it does is display a &#34;thumb keyboard has been stopped and must be quit&#34; or something like that, over and over and over.	1
1140116	I spent over 200 dollars on this game and when I hit level 27, my account reset... wtf I recommend this game to rich people who don't care about money.	1
1145170	Fun but mine updates later wtf?	4
1149460	Normally I'm not big on HOS games, but I didn't see what there was to lose since its free.  I was utterly shocked when it turned out to be a game I look forward to playing every day.  I'm not sure what the draw is precisely.  I do like games where you can level up as you get better, with lots of different missions to choose from.  This offers both, and the best part is that it's seemingly never-ending.  I've been playing every day for almost a month now and there is no end in sight.  When I like a game I don't want it to end. How many other games have I paid for, liked less, and only got a day or two of play out of it?  This is free, and it's endless entertainment.<br /><br />One thing people may not like is that it is energy-based; each time you search a scene it deducts a certain amount of energy.  You can search several scenes before your energy runs out, but once it's gone, you have to wait for it to recharge.  For me, these kinds of games are actually a plus because it forces me to not waste my whole day playing.  Plus I work most days so I run out my energy in the morning, and when I come home in the evening it's recharged.  I think generally it takes about an hour for a full recharge, give or take.  You can also buy energy of course if you are so inclined, but I prefer to wait it out.  Also, each time you level up, you get a full recharge as well.<br /><br />You begin with a couple of hidden object photos to search for various items and as you level up you can unlock more and more.  I have found it also helps to add friends if you want to level up faster.  I didn't even bug my friends on Facebook, I simply googled friend codes for Secret Society and found forums where people post their codes which you can add manually to your friend invites.  I got several friends that way, although 90% of the codes I type in get &amp;#34;invalid code&amp;#34; error messages...not sure what that's about since these people posted their codes that same day.  The game also givesyou 6 free invites per day where they list random players, but most of these are DOA...maybe they used to play but they sure don't anymore.<br /><br />The HOS are challenging.  I probably fail more than I succeed, but as you search the same scenes over and over you get better at finding things.  Also, some of the objects they ask you to find I had never even heard of (wtf is fujiyama?), so you may have to just tap suspicious-looking objects until you find them.  Then you'll know for next time what to look for.  Each time you search a photo, the clues are given to you differently.  Sometimes they are written, sometimes they are silhouettes, sometimes the words are scrambled, etc.<br /><br />There is a backstory to the game and each successful mission gives you a peek at another entry in the diary.  All-in-all, it is a very entertaining game and it doesn't cost you a dime unless you want it to.  VERY HAPPY I took a chance on this one!!	5
1157719	It's silly really ..The graffics are low quality fx what fx it's  like watching a low budget cartoon ..Not to mention the perverts lurking all though the game ..You get to equip weapons like a soft eraser or pencil ? ,wtf .it's a very weird game ...	1
1158987	The latest update keeps saying failed to install wtf?	1
1159133	Had to start over 3 times, lost everything, sometimes I can't play the chest game, it says I need the internet....wtf? Sometimes when an add pops up I can't get it to go away. But I still play. I guess that says something good about it.	2
1168591	It is ok but wtf is up with the captain America one. You need to fix that one	3
1172281	"Ok so they need to take this off of the app store because all that pops up is a black screen and it says \\""Five Nights At Buddy's isn't responding\\""??!!!!!!?!???!! WTF I bought this freaken game because I love scary games but if it keeps saying \\""Five Nights At Buddy's isn't responding\\"" than I'm not gonna buy it I WOULDN'T recommend it to anyone I'm sorry but if you want a BLACK SCREEN and something that says \\""FIVE NIGHTS AT BUDDY'S ISN'T RESPONDING\\"" then go ahead and get this app!!!! Well this is my review for this piece of S*** yes I just said the S word so what that's how  I feel when I play this game well I hope this was helpful bye!!!!!!"	1
1180658	ok ok ... so I got this game and wtf it crashed my kindle and battery goes dead it wouldn't turn on with the charger it took 3 hours to turn on rip of tff	1
1186138	It tells me to update my kindle WTF.Is that for a game	1
1191410	I cant find anywhere to review this place so I a starting a thread here.<br /><br />Eat24 is way too expensive at $5  per order and they are misleading. Essentially to the point of being liars. &#34;Relax, you just made food happen&#34; makes you think an order was placed when it was not. Its such a ridiculous development decision to have this pop up, I am taking the time to start a thread over it.<br /><br />I'm actually really pissed because I was lied to by Eat24 and it caused me to think an order was placed for people at work while we all waited for 2hrs. If I had the energy to sue Eat24 for lying to me, I would do it in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Imagine going to a restaurant and the waiter says, &#34;relax your food is on its way&#34;. What would you think? You would think your food is on its way. wtf Eat24?!	1
1193126	I can't open the game now because of an upgrade not an update..WTF..?	2
1194457	I came on last night and everthings was gone WTF I lost 20 levels and countless friends!?!?!  Fix this now rilosoft.	3
1195472	Bought this, wasted $5. Don't buy if you're on an S5. Let me buy it even though it's incompatible. Wtf?	1
1196202	Does this even work with Fire TV? Can not get it to load and it say &#34;not compatible&#34; WTF so why is it listed as an app? Major reason for the Fire TV was for SiriusXM.	1
1210570	I kind of like this game I rated 5 stars to be nice and wtf?!?!?!?!?!	5
1217326	How missleading! Looks like Betty Crocker, which I searched for, then the recipes I needed were $.99 a piece! WTF! A free app should be at least 80% free! I'm tossing it.	1
1220217	So i got da app but it just gives u info no cheats at all wtf  y they do this stuff huh?	2
1222389	This app will not install on my Kindle Fire.. WTF?<br />My wife has it on her Mac and it works great.	1
1226886	i rate this game 5 stars , but sometimes , it wont let me goon to the game . so i deleted it then i cant log in anymore like wtf . but everything else then that .. it was awesome	4
1231306	At first I said WTF!  But it's original and puts your mind to think.	5
1238499	it made me give a 5 star review so dumb like wtf is that its stupid its a good game but there's no freedom	5
1239757	awkward at first but gets more fun as u progress I started out thinking wtf but I like it now	5
1242129	Amazing game, but the only thing I thought was bad, was the fact that it reset all my progress. WTF?!	4
1246123	When u use this app u have to pay money to get coins to get fake followers. I'm so upset I just wanted more followers on Twitter @MayaWoods16 is that too much to ask I mean I'm a good person I always follow bk. I shouldn't have to pay money for fame followers like wtf .	2
1256232	Ok so, I saw all the good rates and I was like, &quot;Ok I'll get it&quot;. Then, I get really into the game and on the last level. IT STOPS PLAYING and says please rate and keep the game like wtf.	4
1257771	***Update. As of 7-92016, this app FINALLY works on my tablet. Due to Amazon's foot-dragging, I'm only updating this app to two stars.***<br /><br />What a convoluted installation process! In order to install the Prime Instant Video app, I had to disable certain security features, leaving me vulnerable to hackers. Then I had to download Amazon Apps and Amazon Shopping. Only after cluttering my tablet with apps I did not want did I learn that the Prime Instant Video app doesn't even install correctly on my tablet!  I guess I have to sit in front of my computer to watch Prime videos. Lame.<br /><br />Amazon, WTF? This app should have been as easy to install and use as the iPhone app, but you screwed it up. Your insatiable need to corner the market makes you look ridiculously greedy, so much so that I'm considering cancelling my Prime membership. I'm paying a good chunk of money for Prime. Why can't I use Prime Instant Video on all my devices?<br /><br />I will never, ever buy a Kindle. Its limited functionality and lack of a microSD expansion slot make it inferior to other eBook readers and tablets on the market. Pair that with the fact that Netflix offers its instant video app for iOS and Android with no hassle and it becomes obvious that Amazon is hopelessly outmatched. People aren't going to buy Kindle devices just so they can watch Prime Instant video.<br /><br />You aren't likely to lose money if you make a stand-alone Prime Instant Video app available on Google Play, but you may lose money if you continue to charge customers for Prime and yet deny them the opportunity to utilize Prime features on Android devices.<br /><br />It's your move.	2
1258299	Don't buy this game, it's just a really stupid puZzle game that doesn't work. I got this game addition one look at the title screen and I was like &amp;#34;Wtf. Is this just some stupid ad, but it didn't have a little x to it so I hit play.&amp;#34; Just don't buy this game please!!!!	1
1262186	Fun game until you run out of chips and have to PAY TO CONTINUE PLAYING. WTF!?!?!?! What happened to the free part?? :(	1
1264735	I really fail to understand why this application requires being able read my exact location, phone number/identity AND record audio from my microphone. WTF? Others also state it is impossible to close it even with task killers. Is it going to record what is going on around and send it together with my location and phone number to third party companies or what???	1
1265426	I download it and it never loads. Tells me to try again later. Brand new kindle fire HDX ... wtf netflix	1
1266901	The Amazon prime music is great, I love the amount of free music available and the ability to download to device. But<br />wtf is the deal with not allowing downloaded data to be stored on external sd? Fills up device storage quickly! Amazon should be providing better service rather than trying to be like Apple.	1
1267877	I cannot believe I spent any money on this crap.  It doesn't even allow me to set one of the tones as a ringtone...  WTF?  I can sit and select each unlabeled tone and listen to it but that's it.  What a waste.	1
1275903	Terrible install process, horrible user interface and doesn't work on tablets...wtf?	1
1278745	This game is a rip off when I get past the first loading screen I press play and it goes to another screen to load and it doesn't load! Wtf! Creators you are full of üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©!	1
1283746	There are a number of reasons to dislike this game. The number one reason is the fact that you cannot zoom in or out of the hidden object boards. You might not think this little detail is important until you are playing the second HOG and your only option is to poke at the screen blindly until you accidentally collect the objects. Next the mini games are very easy even with the incomplete directions and of course the hint button does not work in areas where you actually need it. Lastly, I was able to download this to my galaxy s5 phone but not my galaxy tablet. Wtf?! This is my fourth big fish game. So far this is the only one I regret purchasing. I am really annoyed.	1
1286292	I downloaded this appmfor my Galaxy S5 and it works great.  However, when I downloaded it for my Nexus 7, nothing!  Wtf??	1
1292627	I used to love this game on my iPhone. I paid 2.49 for an app that crashes as soon as I open the app. Wtf.	1
1293096	OMG WTF love this game beat it in 2 hours also this game gave my brother nightmares for two mounths. What is up with the purple guy in the second game me on night 6 almost did it :D the golden freddy mini game when I did it golden freddy got me and saw a boy in the middle	5
1300647	It says theres not enough space , and I have space wtf?	1
1304856	[This review is for the FireTV version; I don't know if other versions are better.]<br /><br />Ever download an app, start it up, and then just stare at it in a WTF stupor?  This is such an app.<br /><br />The entire UI just a collection of episodes.  No way to search for a particular series.  No organization with all the episodes grouped together.  The names of each episode are often just the episode name, with no series name.<br /><br />This is just unusable.	1
1308581	Wtf this app says that there needs to be an update when theres not one to be found ANYWHERE I've emailed Amazon and they said (and I quote) &quot;were sorry please check to see if your kindle fire is on&quot;.This is unacceptable I've been e-mailing then about since December it's now Janurary 4th this is unacceptable seriously google and apple have this app updated on their app stores but wtf amazon??? I've never been more pissed off in my life also Amazon suggested that I go on Google and update it but I can't because it's not compatible with my kindle fire and that would be violating their own copy right.	1
1311770	Okay well.first it's saying my password and username are wrong wtf . We need instagram and snapchat on here . The app is horrible I.do not recommend this . I'm sorry but it is not good .	1
1317722	WHAT IS THIS I CAN'T GET PASSED THE 13'TH ACT WTF .\/. ARGH!!!!!<br /><br />  __	1
1321413	I don't think I've ever seen an app installation process even 1/10 as annoying as this one. You do not need your own app store. It's silly. Please stop.<br /><br />In the end, even after jumping through all of the hurdles, installing the app store, installing this app, and then using my browser (WTF?) to navigate back to amazon site and try a video, I still got a popup saying that my android device is not supported. I'm running Android 4.4.	1
1322247	Bought it on the kindle fire........not supported on kindle fire.  WTF?!	1
1332923	hshsgsgsgdjdjjdjdhdvvdvd dhduduf fhfyff fhfhfhf fhfhfhf fufhrhr ehsgsgehd d d wtf, tf, tf, tf, tf wtrvtf hw hwwhwhw hshe jfkc fvwgqtdipd bfvfu ncnvt bsodofn htptpnf jrhr t jfjf jhjh hahahahahahaha wtf ftw jdhdhdgzf	5
1336537	I can't play because it won't let me name my character and can only go back like wtf man	1
1340279	If you have a Kindle fire HD I do not recommend this. When I downloaded it it made me wait an hour for it to update it then it wouldn't even work. WTF. Do not download it	1
1343012	Why do they even have this game for is to buy?  Really WTF!!!!!!  Its stupid!  All you so it move the baby things around!  You don't even have the baby to take care!  Fix this game please!  It looks!  And people want to play it but they can't if all you do is move the stuff around!  I hate uty so much!	1
1350598	Have been playing this for some time now. Was up to level 33 with over $865.000 in coins. The game was awsome. This morning I went to collect my bonus and I was at Level 1 again with $2500. I have no game unlocked. WTF???	1
1359276	I would love to play this game I have always liked lego games but this one took 10 minutes to download and then said it didn't download so I downloaded it again but then it said I didn't have any space for the game so I looked at my storage space and I have 1.25gb's open so wtf is wrong I have downloaded a lot of other lego games but this one nope I would give it 0 stars	1
1361813	its a good app but I had it before and then my phone broke...and I got it again and it saved non of my stuff and also afyer a few weeks it starts to take away all the followers it gives you.And whne you first log into it it says &amp;#34;no mission&amp;#34; like wtf...	4
1371924	Only available on Kindle Fire Phones. WTF?<br /><br />AMAZON! NO ONE WANTS TO BUY YOUR WORTHLESS PHONE. WE DON'T WANT TO BE LOCKED IN TO THE AMAZON ECOSYSTEM.	1
1372357	Sorry for 3 stars because I could not know how the f##k to use so plis help wtf I can't know also wtf was that map at 1st so I need more helpful reviews thanks for the support if you helped me :D....	3
1377963	just like the title. wtf jehovah why do so many demand this app to give it such a high rating...	1
1392154	not supported on samsung tablets? WTF!?	1
1393409	After maintenance the might based attack brackets are gone, now I have the choice suiciding against someone 4x my size or wasting my time w someone 1/4 my size... There are absolutely zero peers in my bracket now? Wtf? They've turned a great build and battle game into the little guys being farmed 24/7. I'm done w this game	1
1394855	Omg. When it says it's finished downloading, I pressed it. Then it starts downloading again.  WTF!!!!	2
1396478	When I tried playing this every time I hit play it went to a commercial and the would not let me play because it : are to restart and this happens like 50 time before I deleted this peice of &cent;RAP.!!! ITS LIKE WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS......	1
1401735	not playing any of my videos says experimental player playing wtf!  $5 wasted	1
1402522	Purchased premium version of this game to get all of the premium content. Only thing I got was the ability to resume at checkpoints. The training mode, Zen mode are nowhere to be found. Uninstalled &amp; reinstalled with no luck. WTF?!	2
1405216	I would give this app negative stars if I could. Amazon just put it on my Kindle without my permission. WTF, Amazon?<br /><br />I paid extra for an ad-free version of my Kindle Fire. Now Amazon is doing crap like this. I consider it FRAUD to charge customers for something that's ad-free, then to load onto it an app that includes in-app purchasing. This is clearly a form of ADVERTISING. And it's all the worst because it happened without my knowledge or permission. I am just waiting for the multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against Amazon for doing this.	1
1408112	I have found some strange bugs like when I tried to fast forward once it asked if I spoke Spanish! Wtf is wrong with the game?! Another time I tried to fast forward it asked for my zip code!	3
1408295	It goes on and on about being the first farming &amp;#34;role-playing&amp;#34; game on  mobile, but you can't be a female? I feel like if you can interact with the story, and that's pretty much the whole point, you should be able to change what GENDER you are! WTF!!	3
1408438	Fun game, no idea wtf is going on half the time.	5
1409462	Don't get this app it scams you out of money I tried to watch a show & got a receipt for signing up! Wtf it says $0 then I get charged and its five days for $0 then it goes to $35 after I already paid for the app then I get charged for signing up! I haven't even watched a show it won't work keep your money	1
1413436	I purchased the game and I was so happy. But when I tapped on it the smile left from my face. I was so sad. The app didn't even work. My dad was like wtf. And I played for the app. &eth;¬ü¬ò&iquest;	1
1413928	So far so good<br />Well see how it plays out in the later levels<br />Nice and smooth play though<br /><br />Wtf can  submit	4
1421906	I am not going to ever buy the full v if this keeps on saying &quot;PocketInvEditor has stopped&quot; wtf is wrong with the app???? #UPDATETOBUGFIXPLEASE	1
1422555	Hey I love this game all mg friends have the update on their phones and I'm here like WTF PLZ give us the update	3
1423276	I started playing this game when my friends told me to get it and I'm really good and I had about 30 coins from the game or glu credits and then I log on and I only have 10 WTF fix it please	3
1425263	Awesome until you get to the point where you pretty much have to give the game money to win. When a monster can roll 16 dice with not a single 1 and I roll 1 about 1/2 the time it gets a little silly. If you play prepare for some frustration and some wtf probability moments	2
1425897	The game itself is okay, BUT they need to include better directions,  n more info about the game itself. I have never played Slenderman before,  so I REALLY had no clue wtf I was doing. It only tells you how to move n how to touch your child, THAT'S IT! It doesn't tell you the object of the game, how to fight off the monster, n it doesn't even give you a map! If it came w better directions n a map it'd actually be an alright game.	2
1426781	The new update isn't here yet but it's on my friends phone already? It's the 1.2 update and it's not here!? WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!	5
1430443	The game is fun but what's up with the bonus? You wait for ever to get back on the game and you hit the bonus button and three hundred coins Wtf are you kidding me come on put something on the game to where you can get coins&eth;¬ü¬ò¬Å thanks.	3
1430742	Some people make some stupid reviews someone said something like HOW DO YOU CRAFT wtf some oh yeah and someone said you loose everything when you die...ok thats just f*****g stupid. But I personally love this game. I stayed up till midnight over the weekend.	5
1431607	What the hell. ..<br /><br />Amazon,  i don't know where to begin.<br /><br />First lets start with how long it took to get the app for Android. ..<br /><br />Secondly. .<br />What idiot came up with the installation process for this app?  Please fire him or her.<br />This is the most complicated installation i have ever had. . And i have had a jail broken iPhone before.  So i have to order the app. . Get a link via email,  not for the apk or link to the  play store, but to a whole separate market.<br /><br />Then,  what happens next is a major pet peeve of mine. . I see the icon for the app i want to install as  the sort of cover page for an entire genre of apps. . I go to click on it. . And then the instant video app is no where to be seen... i hate that! !!<br /><br />Upon finally getting app,  downloading. .. it does not even work! !!! !! WTF.<br /><br />If i could i would give this zero stars. . Negative stars. .. imaginary stars like square root of -1...<br /><br />I love Amazon, prime for students is amazing. .. 40 bucks for two day shipping,  on top of GREAT prices,  GREAT selection,  Amazon prime music which is amazing. .. but this app absolutely sucks...<br /><br />My suggestions in chronological order. ..<br /><br />Make it work.<br />Make a filter search option within the app for prime videos only<br />Put it on the Google play store... cut out all the email link Amazon appstore bulshiy! !!!	1
1435412	Lame pointless without the game wtf guys	1
1438261	I like it but I got caught because I made a picture with &#34;WTF&#34; on it...	4
1446415	I play this all the time. Only downfall is after a while, songs will creep in that aren't even close to the genre selected. I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal), and after a couple hours, Bryan Adams played. WTF. LOL	5
1451771	IT DOES NOT WORK I CANT EVEN GET ON IT<br />PLEASE FIX THIS ID LOVE TO GET A MOD AND ALSO I SPENT MONEY ON THIS LIKE WTF<br />IN	1
1453090	It tells me to update Amazon app,  which tells me to update Amazon app, which tells me to update Amazon app.....  wtf?	1
1458288	It won't let me see who's online. It was just fine, I even installed Messenger, and even that app won't let me see who's online. Wtf???? Please fix -____-	1
1460260	Was great...until about a month ago, full screen ads started showing up, with no way to minimize them. That makes this totally news-less. Wtf?	1
1461611	Seems like a super cool, super fun game, and it has lots of great reviews. However, I never actually got to playing it because when you open up the game it shows you the title screen but then it just sits there. So I tap on my screen, still nothing. Then I just wait a little, about an hour, and try it again. Still nothing, BUT this time it said &quot;connecting to server&quot; so I'm like....ok....I guess I can wait a little longer. Another hour goes by &quot;connecting to server&quot;. WTF! What the hell is it connecting to! I know the server is working and fine and my Kindle is always connected to it! I don't know how to rate this, I haven't had the chance to actually play the game yet, again it looks and sounds fun but just won't load. Disappointed.	3
1468263	What they do have for free streaming is no better than Netflix, otherwise you have to rent/buy content, which usually is what you want to watch. While you do get the perks of free shipping and free ebooks. It's not all that worth it unless you buy a ton of stuff off of Amazon.<br /><br />Also my Android phone can use it, but not my Android tablet? WTF.	1
1479966	Thought this would be a great app to catch up on vampire diaries.  But the Adams's that too difficult.  You watch the first segment of video it goes to ads then tried to load and starts the show back over.  Wtf, It really freaking sucks that the ads just loop and I can't watch the rest of the show.  Great teaser!!!  So upset.	1
1482013	I have been playing this for so long! I had ALL the prizes and level wet and over 800 coins. It glitches and asks me if I want to close it and I said okay. Reopened and it's at level 1 as if I've never played. I've had this stupid game over 2 years wtf! Everything is gone!	1
1486472	It worked good for a while and then I updated it and now I can't open my snaps like wtf??? Snapchat please become available to me	4
1488560	its a freaking puzzle wtf is this it says American football I was expecting a game who ever made this is stupid	1
1490594	I'm a prime member. I can't download the prime instant video app to my HTC desire 816... Wtf!! So I can't watch movies. I can do it all on my kindle but not my phone?? What good is one without the other? Why isn't it all one app anyway?? I don't get it.	1
1493709	I try opening a wide and it kicks me off wtf  one star	1

1542962	Give me directions at first how to play???!!!!!!!!!  WTF.  Is it that hard to give a little tutorial?  Maybe there something wrong bc I can't play??	1
1544447	If I could rate this app with a zero, I would.  I am completely frustrated with this app.  After spending the past 45 minutes jumping thru Amazon hoops, I finally figured out how to access the movies.  The only problem is that all I get is &#34;This video is not currently available for this device.&#34;  WTF, Amazon?  I'm using a Nexus 7 (Generation 2) running Android 4.4.4.  Why can't I view anything?  I tried ten movies and get the same error message.  This is totally unacceptable.  Your app is crap!  You should be ashamed of yourselves for offering this unfinished product.  I guess we should all be happy that you're not charging anything for it.	1
1555118	NO COMPLAINTS ...only problem I have is having to write atleast 20 words just to say GOOD JOB WTF IS THAT	5
1559702	Love it wish they made more like it love the food we cook it is so easy omg wtf love it	5

1570459	This is stupid I put my number in and it tells me I have to get viber wtf is going on :/	1
1579098	I downloaded this app and when I opened it, it said this app is currently unavailable and to go online to dominoes.com. WTF?!? How about maybe... removing the app? Losers!	1
1582801	Great game but the ads suck. WTF!	3
1583651	I was so happy when I saw this app but when I tried to use it, the first thing I thought was wtf! It has no instructions or any advice on how to use it, and to be honest I only gave it two stars because I love Death Note so much. And the pictures have nothing to do with the app. Death Note is awesome sadly this app sucks.	2
1583818	Hey cupcakes and dirtcakes AniCake here. So, I love this game!!! LOVE!! So my sister didn't kno about multiplayer so when she found out, she was surprised. &amp;#34;Why are there letters??&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Err.....&amp;#34; I explained. Anyways, I saw that girl recommending sex button. First, eww!! Second, wtf woman!!!! Anyway, I love the game but my only change would be to make all animals and humans free. I think everybody would be happy. So you got that full game thingy on track so why not let all the animals free? I would love to be a human. I also rally wanna be a fox!! Real bad! Thanks. 1GAMES, thank you for being a wonderful creator group I love you MUA!! I love your games!! I just wish I could play your game girl group fight! Please amazon, put girl group fight on appstore! Also, whoever doesn't like the game is wrong. But I respect the fact they don't like it. Yea, its hard at times, but that's what makes it fun. And also, if you complain about how innapropriate people are in multiplayer, don't judge the creators! Its the people who play the game's fault. And also, don't add a sex button like that random and weird girl said. Its both nasty and weird. Anyway, I don't think parents would want to let there kids playing a game that has sex. No, I'm not a teen neither a grown up but I still like typing like this :3 Watch my YouTube channel in like idk 2 years XD maybe one. Thanks and have a great time playing Life Of Black Tiger. Bye, eat a cake soon!<br /> ~AniCake	5
1586058	No idea how to play this, never played any of the other originals... so I'm 100% new. I swiped randomly for a few min and it sounded like I was winning.  No idea wtf is going on.<br /><br />Uninstalled after 5 minutes.	1
1587852	I don't know if it's the new kindle update that is messed up or the game, but the game says it needs to be updated. So I brings me back to here, where normally I would be able to click on update! All that it says is open. Wtf it does this with. Another game of mine too.	1
1593726	Honestly I checked it and it is like wtf for 1YOU RIPPED OFF THR BACKGROUND FROM SIMS YOU BIT H 2 it Sucks paying for everything? Might as well pay for the goshdam app itself and 3 I checked other games by you:almost all of them are FPS and good.	1
1597347	Damn I bugged my mom for this game and I get it but it crashes WTF Scott you better update this game to fix it	3
1597663	Doesn't work on android tablets still. WTF.	1

1612503	Probably the best game around! I would like to say that they should add like different monsters in every region. I just got to the second region. If they are sroung as f#(), and don't tell you that at the first storage, you'd be like... WTF? @anyways, I'm gonna get back to it. SEE YA!	5
1613815	I have a Kindle Fire HDX 7&amp;#34;.<br />Just so we're clear: THIS $2 app is NOT the reader, just the ad blocker. Keep reading.<br /><br />If like me, you found yourself here because you were searching all over the Amazon app store for a decent manga reader, am I right? I searched far and wide, and all I saw in THIS app store that even qualified as a decent manga reader was Manga Searcher. However, I noticed that it did not update a few of my mangas properly, therefore I had to delete it and find another one. Which was futile and almost next to impossible, because of all the bad reviews and ratings for all the other manga readers.<br /><br />However, I stumbled upon this app with 251 coins to spare and I saw the positive reviews, and a one negative review for it. What really caught my attention though, was the attractive interface in the screencaps that persuaded me enough to cough over my 200 coins. Now, when I purchased it, I was panicking because whenever I tapped on the icon, it wouldn't respond. WTF.<br /><br />That was when I had to go back and read the description for this to really understand what it stated. This app is only used to block out the adds from the MAIN app. Like a key. Duh.<br /><br />Now, where's the main app? You can try searching all over the app store for it, but I assure you it's not here. Why? Quite simply put, the best manga readers are found OUTSIDE this store. What?! Yup, after downloading this and panicking, you need to go download the apk file at http://mangablitz.com.au/download.php<br /><br />But what about all those fearful and threatening apks that might run a risk on your device? You might want to go download an antivirus app for that first and run it through the apk file. I did and it was safe! Now, where can I find that download from the site in my device folders? Ahhh, I highly recommend ES File Explorer to find that file, otherwise I don't know how else to find it on a Kindle. After that, once you hit install and run the permissions for it on your device as an apk from an outside source, you're good to go!<br /><br />Now, I'm happily reading all my recently updated manga on a beautiful manga reader interface.  :)	5
1614162	seems like a cool and fun app, but WTF HAPPENED TO CSR?!?!  I STILL HAVE THE GAME, BUT WHEN IT SAYS &quot;NEW UPDATE AVAILABLE&quot;  I GO TO UPDATE IT AND IT SAYS I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN!  THEN, I SEARCHED FOR CSR RACING, AND IT WASNT THERE.  WTF NATURALMOTION?!	4

1629556	Brugh every time I go to use it it seas that &quot;sorry Pocketinveditor has stoped&quot; wtf man fix it!!!!(if u want my opinion this app is a wast of space and time)	1
1633890	I enjoy Fox News on my phone and the web very much but this app, on my 2014 Fire HDX 8.9 *stinks*.  Terrible design; nothing like the regular Fox News app.  Very disappointing.  Also not nearly as responsive as the regular app.  WTF?	1
1635890	The ultimate team does not work they need to fix that and I play the same games over and over again no new games wtf each sports come on!! I	2
1636299	As soon as we downloaded this to my Kindle Fire yesterday it also added a Ghostbuster's Fruit Ninja game with it (WTF???) and I started having numerous problems with my Kindle crashing the abruptly closing other apps and my browser windows.  I'm not 100% sure what the connection is but I know that the ONLY change that happened with my Kindle prior to it suddenly going buggy and crashing repeatedly was this game being downloaded to it yesterday.  This game (and the Ghosterbuster's Fruit Ninja game that mysteriously popped up at the very same time) are both getting deleted as soon as this review is done.	1
1651534	I bought this game for my kids I payed 2,99 for it go to get on and it says I have to pay. WTF I payed and I'm pissed off don't buy it.	1
1654595	v difficult to get coins like wtf not enough people use it and its like &quot;&quot;no mission!!!!&quot; like pls sma and what if i want less than 10 likes okay wow but its the only like app I've found for kindle so whatever	3
1657207	Good graphics but wtf the dinosaurs doesn't move there is only one Dino the map is tiny and I get hit when I'm not near him also he doesn't die!	1
1657535	I started the session, set volume accordingly and heard a very nice woman's voice starting with instructions and information. I started getting sleepy already, then the volume dropped by about 40 percent, which woke me up having to turn it up. Ok, whatever keep listening. Started falling asleep again and 15 minutes later the volume jumps back to 100 percent,startling me awake, wtf? I was furious with it at that point.<br />Either the audio editor for this dev is an idiot, or their way of getting you to buy the full version is completely counter productive to the entire purpose of the app.<br />1 star and a big BOOOOOO	1
1659738	The game is heart wrenching and awesome. But when you (spoiler alert) got to the part where Luke and Sarah are in the house, all of the choices are blank. IDK if it's is supposed to happen, but it is annoying. The people don't talk, and the box literally say,&quot;This choice is blank!&quot; WTF!	4
1662159	Yet ANOTHER app I PAID for for my Kindle fire that I'm having to go and find the .apk file because it's no longer supported yet the .apk I tricked the kindle into installing works great! WTF Amazon..? Your gonna force more people to root your devices..	1
1663913	The game is pretty nice so far graphics wise.  The levels are a lil short but havent plaed it too much so far.  Do have one problem with it so far.  Playing it on my new kindle.  Took a while to get the game to work for me.  Like id click on the game to play it.  Itd load up and id pick everything i wanted for my character.  Soon as i did that itd close out.  Finally got it to work the other day.  Itll let me play a couple levels, then all of a sudden goodbye just completely closes out my game.  Like seriously wtf.	3
1664833	Most recently watched are gone and so is your saved playlist.  WTF?!!!  Honestly, I can't believe someone designed it like this on purpose.	1
1665504	Ok, I'm sure this game is fine, but I haven't tried it yet for ONE reason. And that is cuz IT DOESNT WORK! Every time I TRY to get on, I have an account, for you people who think that's the problem, but when I tap &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; it says &amp;#34;please update your application with a new version&amp;#34;. WTF??? Other than that, very needed to be fixed bug, I'm sure, if the game IS like the vids, that it's fine.	3
1669730	I want to like this game, but I can't. IT'S 'TUPID AND SOMEWAT HARD. *derpface* (Some are like &quot;Wtf really?&quot; And others r so hard it's like #ragequit	3
1670767	I love amazon, and the tablets but not having certain apps like snap chat is annoying... can't get coins no matter how many free ads wtf is the point of this app if I need points to view... stop with the fake snap chat and just make the app compatible please and thanks	2
1674914	I upgraded the app and lost support for my receiver!!! Check the forums before you upgrade as you can't get the old version!!! WTF?	1
1680348	your probably thinking I'm gonna write a complaint about it glitching or so but that is not what I'm gonna tell you ,my complaint is it is as hard as Mortal Kombat Trilogy. I mean when your beating the Vikings bad 3-21 on easy that's right I said EASY.All the sudden, Fumble he grabbs the ball and takes off like super-man,juking every nook and cranny that comes at him although 5 saints players make a Jenga stack on him. And start trying to truck him(which we all know how hard saints linebackers hit)he still resists, touchdown Vikings. WTF happened there? and then number 8 is passing it to WR number 16<br />and out of God knows where, who should we find Intersepting the ball but the worst CB in the NFL<br />again he won't go down 3 or 4 touchdowns later it was the end of the game score 68-39 Vikings win	1
1683120	This is sooooooooo poopy. So lemme get this straight, I cut the cord from the cable companies, get my FireTV and it kicks butt. The thing is loaded with all the shows and movies I could possibly want, and poopball PBS wants me to enter my local cable account user/pass combo?!?! WTF?! What part of &#34;cut the cord&#34; are they not getting?!?!?!<br /><br />SOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed, and by PBS, too!!	1
1687670	The YouTube keeps stopping when I press a video, before it didn't stop now it does,wtf happened.<br />I can't watch nothin now	1
1689500	I have been playing and enjoying the game until they released the update just recently....foolish me, I installed it. Did you guys actually test it on a Kindle?!?!?! Now the game has a quick flash screen of the opening page and then.......NOTHING!!!!!! WTF!?!?	1
1691119	Honestly it was a really good app when I got it. But now, ever since the new update (10/22/14) it SUCKS. I go onto a video that I like, and the whole app shuts down!!!!! Get your poop together video tube!!! Like, wtf!? And even before the new update it was STILL buggy! I can't even. (-_-) ) I just can't.	2
1694849	THUD APP IS A DEFINITE FAIL...It has nothing but YouTube videos,an Enrique Iglesias song....Wtf...Don't waste 99&cent; for this app!!!!! The reason I  rated it one star is because it wouldn't let me submit without rating!!!!!	1
1694875	It says it is for android, but after I downloaded it it says it's not compatible. Wtf?!	1
1695507	I loved it for a long time now when I try to watch 99% of the videos it shuts down wtf damn app is good untill you can't even watch your favs	1
1697564	As of 8:14 10/23/2014. I downloaded this app and try to log into my profile. It keeps showing me error messages. I`m like okay? I'll just look at a stream. THAT didn't work! It came up with a error message saying: the network is down. I said okay?! So I try looking at Twitch on my PC. Guess what! Twitch is working on my PC! WTF?!	1
1697928	Why does my Facebook keep crashing every 10-20 secs on my Kindle Fire HD?..It was working Perfectly before and I didn't even install this new update cuz I knew shiit like was gonna happen..WTF fix it Facebook.	1
1704568	I started a new business.  I bought a Blu cell phone from Amazon for my new business.  I downloaded Amazon Local Register on my new Blu business phone that I bought from Amazon...WTF!!!!  Here's the message I got:  &#34;It appears your mobile device operating system has been altered or jailbroken. Mobile devices that have been altered from the default Android or iOS operating systems present a security risk, and are not supported by Amazon Local Register.&#34;  So I can't use an Amazon App on a phone I bought from Amazon...messed up.  Feeling like I should be returning everything back to Amazon....like others have said...this thing's a headache...don't get it...go to Square...the 1% savings for 2 and a 1/2 months is not worth the hassle!!!	1
1705745	When I did this all it did is say naugty than nice over again WTF!!!!!!!<br />Whirlpool begging bang b v.	1
1711760	Fun to play. I can't stand the noise it makes. WTF is that all about. I uninstalled it. Annoying as hell. You can't play it around other people without bothering them.	1
1713846	It was working fine until last Sunday when it said I have to download the update to run the app, so I did thinking nothing of it. Once the update was completely finished I went to open it and nothing!!!! WTF.... So I click on it again and it said guess what? Must download the update to run this app, so full me once shame on you full me twice shame on me....Now I can't even change my lineup unless Amazon or when Amazon decides to address this problem which who knows when that will happen....	2
1721929	It needs wifi wtf?	1
1722345	It won't download wtf I hate fifa<br />.	1
1726275	It worked fine until today when it said it had an update, I got the update and then I opened it back up, of course you know ready to manage my teams, and it said I had another update, like wtf I just got the update, please fix it	2
1727481	I love this game but I'm getting real close to uninstalling it! Every time someone gives me a life or anything else it won't let me accept them. I click on the accept button and it doesn't do anything and eventually freezing. I log off and back on and all the lives etc are gone. WTF? YOU NEED TO FIX IT OR ME AND ALL MY FRIENDS WILL UNINSTALL IT!	2
1732776	I love the game and the graphics are great but I was playing and I need the update wtf amazon get the f ing update I'm not happy	4
1737534	I enjoyed this game but some opponent bases were unbeatable. My ships surrounded the the last opposing team's base, beat shield down to zero, then just sat there hammering it and it never converted to my team. Meanwhile enemy ships started taking over my bases. WTF??<br /><br />The inability to divide your ships up is a frustrating handicap when it comes to strategy.<br /><br />It would also be nice if there were a way to see the opposing team stats to inform decisions about which team to attack.	2
1745097	I got to play the first game and then when I signed up too open the pack it took me too main menu and every time I try to play ultimate team it always says there was  a problem connecting to fifa 14. I don't know wtf too do	2
1745711	I was charged $19.98 by this free app. When attempting to close an ad (which are abundant), I accidentally opened it instead (and immediately closed it, annoyed with the whole process). I then received a text message thanking me for subscribing. It said respond with &#34;STOP&#34; if you wanted to unsubscribe. I didn't know that I had actually subscribed to anything, but I immediately responded STOP anyway.<br /><br />Then I get my cell phone bill at the end of the month. I've been charged twice for buying &#34;play credits.&#34; WTF. I was NEVER asked for payment info or asked &#34;Are you sure?&#34; or anything. They simply added it to my Sprint bill, and hoped that I wouldn't notice.<br /><br />Unethical, evil, lame. I deleted the app immediately and am trying to get my money back. Do not download this app.	1
1745962	Many of these reviews must be fake. I was charged $19.98 by this free app. When attempting to close an ad (which are abundant), I accidentally opened it instead (and immediately closed it, annoyed with the whole process). I then received a text message thanking me for subscribing. It said respond with &#34;STOP&#34; if you wanted to unsubscribe. I didn't know that I had actually subscribed to anything, but I immediately responded STOP anyway.<br /><br />Then I get my cell phone bill at the end of the month.

They simply added it to my Sprint bill, and hoped that I wouldn't notice.<br /><br />Unethical, evil, lame. I deleted the app immediately and am trying to get my money back. Do not download this app.	1
1747462	After spending at least $20 in app purchases and a long grind I made it to level 49. Than a few days ago al my progress disappeared! I have sent multiple emails and  have not even got a confirmation. Unbelievable!!! I recommended this game if you enjoy having hard earned levels stripped from you and you hard earn money throw out the window. This was almost a five star game for me. Now no stars. Just flat out disappointment.<br /> My only complaint about the game other than the one above Is  the ridiculous waiting time for level ups,upgrades and builds. I mean days. Like 5 days to level up a weapon. WTF.	1
1750653	This is for a failed attempt to install the instant video on my Nexus 7.<br />I downloaded the Amazon app store..  And then the Amazon prime instant video.  We had a working Kindle Fire that no longer charges so we know the app.  We also have it on the ipad WHERE IT WORKS GREAT!  WTF AMAZON.  This is bs...  It should work on all my devices period.<br />Ask me how I feel about your service....  Please.	1
1756329	I cannot get the game to save past level (day) 9. No matter how far I progress, I keep getting rolled back to level 9. I spent over 2 hours playing today and got to level 42. I did the 'save and exit' button then did other things for awhile. I came back to tackle level 42 but alas! I was back to level 9. All my achievements, unlocked goodies, everything... gone. I even tried creating a named profile and started at the beginning. I made it to level 12 then did 'save and exit' once again, then closed the app. When I opened it, low and behold I was back at level 9. WTF???? I will not waste anymore time with this game. It's so much fun but I can't keep doing the same levels over and over again and I certainly don't have the time to finish the entire game in one sitting. Please fix this or I'm deleting it.	2
1757437	It keeps crashing on me WTF!!?	3
1758079	It took forever for this app to come out, especially considering that kindles technically run on android. I figured it was because they wanted to add Chromecast support... nope.  WTF?	1
1769777	this is so retarded I hate it it wont let you use the wallpaper its stupid if I could give it a 0 star I.would I'm like wtf its is dumb don't get it	1
1773866	This has been such a handy app to have. I keep all kinds of records and notes on it and one look and you can find what you want because each title is visible.<br /><br />I would really like it if you put the icon picture back on it instead of having NO IMAGE AVAILABLE. WTF?	5
1773948	Now you aren't going to listen to me and you'll download this regardless of what I say, but honestly DO NOT waste your time. It's full of nothing but movies from like the 20s and it doesn't even open. Instead it just opens your browser and takes it to a coupon site. Like wtf, I wanna watch movies, not get coupons! It doesn't have movies from the century on it. None of the movies that it says in the pictures. I should sue you for false advertising. Worthless douche bags.	1
1776610	Best game ever. I'm serious. Now your wondering why it's one star. I went play in a tournament but when I opened the app it reset wtf I was just in level two	1
1777031	So I downloaded it to watch RM files on my kindle, which is what I use it for on my computer (which it only works on my desk top Windows 7 but NOT on my windows 8 Laptop, WTF?), so I am a little disappointed that this version doesn't work (either), but not surprised.	2
1785189	The graphics are lovely, gameplay is intricate and clever. You can read all the numerous compliments in other reviews. ;) I loved it at first, but it's become one of &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; games that I'm not dying to get back to. There is, in my mind, a BIG annoyance. I like order, like to complete games fully if I possibly can. What drives me mad about this is that the levels are purposefully made so you don't have what you need to complete them. Yet. Wtf? So you can do the level but you don't have the right costume, knowing that you'll have to complete a bunch more levels to earn whatever it is you need and then come back and play it again. And figure out the puzzles. Again. See what I mean? Do do yourself a favor, fly through the levels, don't spend a lot of time getting all the stuff. Cause you gotta replay a bunch again anyway. If you're a type A person, consider yourself warned.	3
1787884	This is a good app. I've spent no money but a lot of time,almost a year of playing. It has its glitches. Recently &amp;#34;killer frost&amp;#34; battle came into play and it glitched my game &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; , I have around 35+characters all built up and 1,000,000 coins just from playing battles over and over. I won her once and now when I scroll over to pick her or any characters in that General area my game shuts off:(  wtf. I'm playing on kindle fire and this needs to be fixed. I don't know what to do. I can't even buy or upgrade my gold characters if I wanted to.	1
1791477	*sigh* don't know why cc changed but in my opinion it needs to change back. Recently finished episode 13 lvl 186, i've only made 3 one dollar purchases to skip the 3 day wait period. on my fourth i get a email verifying my purchase but lo and behold no level skip!!!!!! wtf!? candy crush you're slacking it!!!!	1
1792961	I really enjoy this game, but I have a few problems with it.<br />1) The prices on the items are WAAYY too high. My 105 salary person takes 2 MONTHS to just get them out of there fear of food. They wouldn't eat because they disliked food. WTF<br />2) It is never upgraded, it is always the same few things in the flea market.<br />3) It goes by too fast, I was gone for just an hour, and all my kids which were triplets of age two,, moved out after an hour. -_-	4
1809749	When I try to get a mod is says failed<br />WTF???	1
1813003	Fat boy? Wtf it's not in movie also controls are complicated. It's just confusing.I hate it so much	1
1814792	Great game but with the last challenge my device keeps crashing when I try and access my characters. I obtained the frost character but I every time I try and get my characters the app characters wtf???? Pls fix this	5
1816061	I think I might be being a little harsh I like this game but it needs more skins and skin helping tools. It could also use a longer campain.<br /><br />Ps wtf was that guy doing	4
1818856	Bruh I thought this was gonna be a good app. Wtf. Fix this. How tf do I get coins. How do I send stuff. This app is terrible btw. This needs improvement.	1
1834742	Amazingly fun but wtf is up with the daily challenges. I havent gotten a single one for 4 months. Please fix for five stars.	3
1844299	very fun game but the semi is the fastest car wtf and takes while to get the money for upgrades	4
1844775	I'd give this thing 0 stars if I could it has nothing to do with tank combat hell I don't even know wtf to do with it it says puzzle and memo videos I mean wtf ????	1
1852359	Now when I open it it says that my phone isn't supported...  Wtf?	1
1853929	I used to really like this game. I spent A LOT of coins on a cue that I really like and want to continue to use. They just recently decided to make all the cues have powers that exspire after only a few uses making my very expensive cue useless. Unless I spend another ridiculous amount of money. Wtf! Not cool! We should be able to have the option to choose. This makes me want to delete this game all together and give you people no more money at all. Thanks for nothing.	1
1855033	This game is a complete RIP OFF. I just found out that I have to sell HALF my buildings to get my population down from 1500 to 700 so I can build that stupid University! So now I have a ton of vacant space that I paid REAL money for (my own fault I know), but WTF is up with these developers that think this was a GOOD thing???? DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!!! Or be prepared to SELL SELL SELL if you are over 700 pop and want to build the university. Note: Takes 4 hours for it to produce coin/items so if you're trying to fill that quest GOOD LUCK!!!	1
1855728	When time runs out for you th@'s it, but when the time runs out for your opponent they still get 2secs. to shoot, plus this new s*** w/ the cues &#34;wtf&#34; makes you want find another pool game. Used to be a good game. When I 1st played 8ball pool I would have given it 5 stars...	3
1860202	This requires acces to you files camera device id info, location...wtf? Opera mini does not. Get opera mini	1
1865692	It helps your likes get up but it loads a little slow like wtf but ITS a good alternative I like it in general and it stops a lot they need to work that out but really overall I like it	5
1868977	Cannot close the window when looking at photos. WTF? Pretty useless.	1
1874263	This editing app is amazing. But, it takes several minutes to upload. Then it takes about 15 minutes to upload to your gallery, like wtf? It also takes away the quality and makes the audio sound poor. But the filters and the captions are really great.	4
1878290	This games sucks your too slow it's to dark even in the Ray your Sprint runs out too fast the graphics are terrible and the pages glitch out!!!!!!!!! WTF ITS THE WORDS HORROR GAME EVER!!!!!!!	1
1879941	I can't even open it anymore! Wtf  ever since the update the app won't open and all I get is that stupid message stating that it's stopped. This is the WORST GMAIL APP EVER!	1
1894600	I try tonplay Lady gaga poker face and it puts on Adele rolling in the deep. Like wtf so stupid and frustrating. Not highly recommended	2
1897095	DAMNIT!  MAKE APP AVAILABLE FOR FIRE TV!  I bought the stupid thing (fire tv) and none of the apps are made for it - WTF????	1
1913909	Waze constantly forgets everything.  Dozens of times I have opened it and it's forgotten all my user information, settings, favorite places, etc.  It's especially great when it does this while I'm on a trip and I haven't written the address down anywhere else and have to search through old emails to find it, etc.<br /><br />It also forgets your routes while driving down the road.  Like it will automatically find a new route that saves you time, which is nice when it works, but then if the data connection goes down, it can't download the new route, so it FORGETS THE ROUTE you are on!  So you're stranded in the middle of nowhere with no data connection and it doesn't know how to navigate you anywhere.  It's so stupid.  It should remember all previous routes and load them back up if it can't connect.<br /><br />If you send a report and the data connection is down, it gives up and says &#34;durrrrr sending failed&#34;.  WTF??  Just keep retrying until it goes through, stupid!  I can't report it again!  Especially not while driving!<br /><br />Probably half the time you try to report a road closed, it doesn't let you.  There's no arrow at the road you want to report.	3
1917188	I played this app and it is fun but there is a several buttons with foul language or explicit phrases. I noticed some buttons with the phrases &amp;#34;let's have sex&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;f--k off&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;surprise motherf--ker&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;dumb_ss&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;WTF BOOM&amp;#34;, and more. Also some say &amp;#34;bats!#d&amp;#34;, and mothef--ker. I recommend this for kids 11+.	4
1919135	This game is fun, I agree. But the biggest complaint I have against this app/game is that it promotes racist ideals. Maybe racism is a harsh word but all the top looks for the events are almost always white blonde haired models. I create my entry avatar in my image, which is not white and blonde, but I create pretty decent fashion combinations. I feel like I put a lot of effort into my creations but do not get the prizes because of skin/hair color. Even though a model of lighter skin and hair, wearing the EXACT same outfit as my model, would get full points. And the app does nothing against this discrimination. Even in some of the events like African Queen, or something, the white and blonde haired models win! WTF! How is that logical, they aren't even African. This game does nothing for people who aren't the typical model shape and color.	2
1923118	On day my mom walked in on me to find me jerking off in bed to this app like wtf mom?!?!!!	5
1923200	This app is not a useful widget. One time when I was going downstairs in the dark for a midnight snack and this thing messed up. It kept showing ads and gave my kindle a virus. WTF happened? This is supposed to help you in the dark and all it does is give headache and virus. It took over my whole kindle :-( I'm never gonna make this mistake and get apps from these providers again!! Sorry but no thank you.	1
1924190	Every time I open it and go to my songs it shuts down......wtf please fix this because it's very annoying	1
1926557	I open a world, click any of the buttons and it says it stopped and then quits!!! WTF?!? Glad it was free.<br />I'm a computer geek and amazing when I want a mod. But this says you can edit your inventory and stuff. Didn't work so I'm mad.&amp;#62; :(	1
1931761	I'm so made I hate it its so stupid it messed up my kindle it wouldn't turn on the it wouldake my screen blank then I deleted it and it wouldn't get off!!! like wtf I hate it does not deserve the space on an app store!!!!!:////// lord this makes me mad!	1
1938584	THIS GAME IS ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT FROM FAMOUS IGG GROUP.<br />This game is very similar to its kind: clash of clan and castle clash. However it's not a copycat of either games. It comes with own mechanic:<br />1) hero with the skill where you are the one to activate it.<br />2) WTF is mana??? So they minimize the resources to only one kind: the precious gold.<br />3) To avoid abusing gold. You have to questing and raiding in order to gain rings/points to lvl up the hero skill.<br />4) you get items/ hero's from the chest every time you clear the map.<br /><br />After you read my comment, if you find it is useful and want to try the game.<br />Please consider putting my code as the invitation code: 185 894 003<br /><br />Thanks	5
1952928	Unless you rate it.  Wtf?	1
1955670	My app no longer works...wtf?! It Keeps telling me &#34; not available and force close&#34;<br />I dont know how to fix but without the Kindle app, this tablet is just a thin paperweight and of no use to me.	1
1967405	HATE the fact that there is no way to quit tgis appbesides turning off my phone. Every other app I own can be quit from the task manager, but not Audible. WTF amazon?	1
1972265	Horrid! I did everything they said and I press hack and it say I hacked it and I checked and says nothing but 0 everything. Wtf!!!!	1
1972797	Hey Amazon, WTF?!? My fully charged phone becomes critically low on battery in about eight hrs. (It usually lasts me two days.) I investigate and find that even though I haven't even opened it today, this app used 667 MB!!! I haven't used the app at all in several days - and I have no songs downloaded in the app at all. I can understand some minor data transfer - I'm sure I'm &#34;paying&#34; with some form of information - but using hundreds of MB of my data plan in a few hours without my knowledge or involvement? And using cellular data even though I have the &#34;only use wi-fi&#34; checked in the settings? Very NOT Cool!	1
1973281	This app has problems, It locks up after a book purchase but before a complete download. Delete the book and start over, or download from a laptop and find the book on your Android. I have an Experia Z1, this app runs the back light at 100%. No other app has uncontrolled brightness. Don't give me a lecture on the brightness control it full on, gets warm and runs the phone down in 4 hours, WTF fix this and for gosh sakes beta test it on many platforms.	1
1973312	I WISH I could write a review of this app. So far, I am on Day 4 of trying to establish a user account.<br /> If you plan on giving this a try, I recommend trying to get an account created before you order the card reader. Amazon was lightening fast in taking my $10 and sending me a card reader. So, I downloaded and installed the app. The first thing you need to do is create a user account.<br />Day 1: Several attempts at entering my business (S-corp) info. Multiple error messages saying my info is invalid, finally a message telling me to wait for an email with further instructions.<br />Day 2: received email from Amazon saying they need to verify my tax ID info. they asked me to scan and send them the IRS letter assigning my EIN (employer identification number). I find the letter that the IRS sent me 11 years ago, scan it and email it back to Amazon.<br />Day 3: Waiting.<br />Day 4: receive email from Amazon saying they can'y verify my info, and they need me to scan and send them a copy of a bank statement or utility bill for my business. WTF????? WTF AMAZON???? In my 11 years in business I have had merchant accounts with at least 4 merchant services processors, everything from ISO's to major international banks. NO ONE has ever required this much documentation.<br /><br />By contrast, I signed up with Square at the very beginning. I was able to create an account within 10 minutes, and had my bank account linked in two days. Easy.<br /> I process about $20K per month in credit/debit transactions. The savings with Amazon would be significant, but I am seriously starting to wonder if it is worth the hassle. Also wondering if other aspects of their service will be as mismanaged as the account setup.<br />Other reviews have stated that Amazon does not automatically transfer your funds into your bank account. They keep them in your Amazon account, and you have to manually transfer them to your bank. If this is true, that's just one more hassle to deal with.<br />Amazon- get a clue: I have a business to run. I immensely value a company or service that can both save me money and make my life easier. So far you have promised the first, and failed miserably at the second.	1
1973870	I have been playing &quot;Frozen - Free fall&quot; for a long time now (level 65), &amp; it is an INSULT to the movie. In every way possible, it is OBSCENELY difficult. I'm very early into &quot;Maleficent - Free fall&quot; (level 8), but so far it's easier to get past levels in it. The character models are also more detailed in it. It probably will get harder later on (it has a system of item use that is needlessly complicated &amp; distracting for this kind of game), but here's hoping that &quot;Maleficent - Free fall's&quot; developers have learned from &quot;Frozen - Free fall's&quot; well deserved hatred, &amp; don't allow this game's difficulty to reach WTF!? levels of difficulty.	4
1977074	Spent over 20 minutes with your help desk trying to get the new version to load with the 3 white lines in upper left corner so I could get free music since I am a Prime member. Downloaded, did not work; uninstalled and tried again. WTF? Old version or new; either should work. Turns out you must have Android 4 or better on your device. My Samsung is 2 yrs old and will not work with Prime Music app. Thanks for nothing Amazon!!	1
1978155	I really love this game but I only gave it 4 stars becuz it keeps buying things I don't need. 1 of my children were playing it and then it said phurchase complete. I mean like wtf she did not buy anything! I have been losing up to 300 dollars from my account becuz of this game. I deleted it becuz I could<br />Not afford to lose any more money. Fix the prob l emailing and ill keep playing it.	4
1978703	Makes wonder WTF .	3
1981072	It made me reset my freaking password for ig am I gonna get hacked wtf<br />Other than that it's okay	4
1985895	NOT BAD, TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO WORK!!!! :-L  BUT STILL, BETTER THAN B4! :p Many other Android &#34;apps&#34; are better, even free ones in which a &#34;TRIAL&#34; is given (USUALLY as &#34;FREEWARE&#34;) to TRICK YOU into purchasing this product.... /SHEESH!! WTF IS THIS GARBAGE!?!?!?!???!?  This .exe is a TRUE-2-LIFE &#34;RIPPPPPP-OFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!&#34; ;-)<br /><br />- Jed M.

1990889	So, I'm vegetarian.  Not a big deal, and they have a pre-built in filter for vegetarians - great!  Except I turn on the filter, search for soups, and immediately get recipes for beef and chicken - wtf?!  Go back and it's unset itself.  Happens repeatedly.  I can set a manual filter for not-beef, not-chicken, etc, and that seems to be semi-permanent, but it's also limited to eight items (and I need to exclude much more than eight).<br /><br />I *can* manually search for recipes and have the vegetarian filter remain in effect - but that rather negates the entire concept of the spinner-thing.  Ends up being comparatively useless for vegetarians.	1
1993089	I re-downloaded this game after having beaten it months prior, and some stupid thing with a jumping coin keeps blocking the screen. It wasn't like this before. Now I'm hearing the game has a virus? Wtf?!	1
1993170	"Before you blow $6.99 of your hard-earned after-tax dollars, you should always get as much data as you can about a product, give it a \\""test drive\\"" even, see if it has the fit, feel, features and ergonomics and works as an interface with whatever device(s) you have.<br /><br />If you're looking for such a product, this ain't it.<br /><br />It LOOKS like it should work.  But after a half hour of going through each menu with painstaking care, I've yet to get a connection with my KX3.<br /><br />This is odd, because on my laptop I can interface Ham Radio Deluxe, Win4K3Suite, Elecraft's software (of course) but not this one (meaning, it's NOT the radio), but the software.<br /><br />Even if it COULD connect, the features I really want to see in operation - waterfall, spectrum - are disabled in the trial version.<br /><br />WTF?<br /><br />Even the makers of HRD allow a 30 day free trial and you can still find ver. 5.24 online - free - but what's available for tablets for portable use?  Back to the forums."	1
2001743	hi pplz it's liv again (meez user and old Amazon user livyk222 some of u might know me) but meet nation.....

2002154	The ai is very low, if my partner thinks I'm winning they'll play off no matter the circumstances. Ex: we took wheels, &quot;bid 13&quot; my partner was cutting diamonds so I played the 3 of diamond. The cpu plays the 2 and my partner plays off with a 6 of heart. WTF REALLY WE JUST BID 13<br /><br />Also, if I bid nil I'm making nil. Why does my partner always lead off with the little joker or a king? Sacrificing bags they need it doesn't help me and it always leaves them short of their bid<br /><br />Great game for beginners though	1
2007678	Omfg don't buy this f**king game wtf worst game ever don't buy I'm deleting this god damn game l hate this every one delete this app	1
2014327	With wifi active this app sucks have to turn off wifi and use data wtf...	1
2024544	Suddenly there  is NO SEARCH BOX.<br />((where'd it go??))<br />I am UNABLE to search for ANY VIDEOS!<br /> ((WTF?? WHY?? ))<br /> I can only view/download the videos that &amp;#34;the app&amp;#34;  feels like displaying!!<br />I have NO CHOICE in the decision making process.<br />...  If i want to see a video with &amp;#34;kittens&amp;#34;  in it,<br />the app might decide to show me RACE CARS or any other random videos?!!?	1
2025994	PvsZ,  but from 4 sides.  It gets hard fast since you have 4 sides to deal with.  Which is challenging,  but what is frustrating is that you have the wait to place your defenses down, cause the 2 characters are busy building already.  Wtf?  If I can build it,  I should be able to!!!  The zombies are coming full speed,  but you have to wait?  PvsZ is not like that.  If the resources are available to you, then you can build, that's the way it should be.<br />Then there is the clear all,  it clears everything,  even your own defenses, everything in that quadrant.  Played for a few hours,  frustration got to me,  Uninstalled.  Okay, I re-installed, it's really hard!  :D	3
2028905	At 1st I thought it was just me, because I can't play w/any or visit the cities of my friends because they all have a newer version than me. Then I come here trying to see if I could hurry along MY update somehow by logging in and I realize EVERYONE with a kindle, playing THIS game, has THIS problem!! I mean really wtf?!?! So I'm following suit and I'll change my comments and give you a better rating when I get updates so I can play along w MY friends.	1
2030173	IT WAS NOT WORTH ANYTHING RIGHT AFTER I WENT SURFING AND HAD A SHARK HIT ME IT SAID I WAS CALM!!!!!!!!!! WTF!!!!!!!!!!	1
2034160	Thanks to all the reviewers that gave this app 5 stars by saying 'great' or 'excellent' and that is it....why waste the trons?  This app is alright....it's improved significantly over the past year.  It used to crash once a week and would be offline for 24 hours.  It crashes a lot less frequently.  I only use it over Wifi and have the data disabled.  A negative to this is the app will let you know every 15 seconds that you have disabled the data capability from the app.  WTF?	3
2042625	****WARNING**** do not spend any money/coins on this game, as you might get ripped-off!!!<br /><br />I am very upset! I had played this game for several days, bought gems with real money, was playing without problems up until right now... I logged in as usual using my facebook info, and the game started from the very beginning, asking me to pick out my main character, which I had already done before! I double checked I was on the correct server (I was) tried several more times to log in and each time it would start up at the beginning of the game as if I was a new user. WTF happened? I am going to attempt to contact the developer, but so far have been unable to locate contact info. I will update this review with any further details, but for now ****BUYER BEWARE****	1
2046876	This game is fun and would probably get 4 or 5 stars if it worked right and customer support did their job, but it freezes and crashes every time I play.  It wasn't bad  a  first, but gets worse as I advance through th  game.<br /><br />The first time I bought gems, I accidentally removed the game from my Kindle and lost all progress and the gems were lost.  Since  it was  my bad in removing the game, I let it go.<br /><br />The second  time I bought gems, I had two bonuses on the purchase, so I let myself get lured in.  And the game crashed in the middle of the purchase.  Since  I was charged  for the purchase, but the gems never got credited to my game, I<br />contacted customer support.  All &quot;Mary&quot; wanted to do was close my ticket.<br />Mary: &quot;Please send a screen shot of you purchase.&quot;<br />Me: &quot;I already sent a screen shot of my Amazon account showing the charge.&quot;<br />Mary: &quot;Please send a screen shot of your purchase.  If I do not hear from you in 24 hours, I will assume your issue has been resolved an  close your ticket.&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Here is another screen shot.&quot;<br />Mary: &quot;I cannot open that file. If I do not hear from you in 24 hours, I will assume your issue has been resolved and clbose your ticket.&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Here is the file format you requested.&quot;<br />Mary: &quot;Please send me a screen shot of your purchase.  If I do not hear from you in 24 hours, I will assume your issue has been resolved and close your ticket.&quot;<br /><br />WTF?!!!<br /><br />The last contact I had from them said my issue was being turned over to tier 2.  It has been months and I haven't heard anything since.	1
2049783	Dear Amazon,<br />Had I purchased this with real money not free Amazon Coins, I would take this time to demand my buck back. As such I offer the following exclamation: WTF?! This game is boring. No music, no sound effects just a nonchalant text alert when you make progress. Animation is okay I guess but the menu is so lackluster...I just can't even...<br />Just terrible.	1
2051951	It's an awesome game with tons of different kinds of quizzes about food/games/tv etc. The only problem I have with it is that it constantly downloads a ton of images on my device without my permission!! WTF!! I don't want pics of random people on my kindle fix that problem and I'll give it five stars.	3
2052031	Keeps saying can't connect wtf it's getting Annoying my 4g is working nd wifi dont work to says can't connect !!!	2
2055707	Has nothing to do with kayaking. Yet every time I see it in an app store, I have to open it and read the description again.<br />WTF were they thinking when they named this app?	1
2056448	This app was a complete waste of time. I got this so that I may learn some more about how to draw anime and stuff like that. Instead I only get to draw like four things and all the others are locked and can only be unlocked in the full version. Please fix this!! It's getting on my nerves and I do NOT recommend it. If u like wasting time, go ahead. But if Ur smart and want what u want lol, then don't get this app. I mean, why put an anime Katy Perry on the cover just to tip ppl off?? It's just dumb. Don't get this app. :/ :# like Wtf man?? #!@$*&iexcl;%&iquest;&iquest;	2
2056999	Yea, on Kindle HD you have to install air, but then when you try to get it it says it's not compatible. WTF ??????? I'd love to get this app,but make it accessible!	1
2064089	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! If you don't get this game there is something seriously wrong with you. Quit wasting time reading these reviews and just get it already...dude what are you waiting for??? Huh?? Wtf? Are you still reading this?? GET THE GAME ALREADY DAMN IT!! Ok see .now your just upsetting me and that's uncalled for. I've been working all day under the hot sun the least you could do is stop freaking reading my review and start hitting that install button...ok?? Ok thanks pal now you've totally ruined my appetite and I'm really getting angry...I hope I don't take it out on my girlfriend and if I do you only have yourself to blame. She burnt my french toast yesterday morning anyways so she's kinda asking for it. Whatever man do what you want but don't come crying to me when you realize what you've missed. It's a shame watching you waste your life away reading this. It's like talking to a brick wall but I guess some people just can't get it through their thick skull. You have issues man...seriously....issues. Go get them fixed, come back, get this game, and get on with your life.	5
2072526	Amazing strategy game.  Don't be fooled by the simple graphics, this game gives you tons of content, various game modes, 6 difficulty levels, unlockable content, and hours and hours of balloon bursting fun.  Also, of course, have in-game buying options for a lot of things, none of them really required.  They get the things easier, but is not like you can't made without them.<br /><br />The content difficulty covers all ranges: from the easy tracks to the &#34;WTF how i'm supossed to win&#34; ones.  The Daily Challenge and Ramdom Missions are very challenging too. If you like tower defense games, this one is a must have.	5
2073017	the game is fun and all but it keeps telling me its out now and I haven't gotten it yet. WTF?	4
2075600	All offensive humor (to some) aside, I call shenanigans! Earlier, there were many one star reviews and now there is only one ( 2 if this one makes it!). That is more fishy than an Oriental market! Wtf! The g5 Mafia is out on this one! This game is food whack-a-mole! It should be called Whack-some-meat! It should also be renamed to &amp;#34;15 dollar minimum wage&amp;#34;! If it was truly about &amp;#34;success &amp;#34;, you should have to balance the books, order the supplies, do r&amp;d, make payroll and pay your taxes! Flipping burgers is for peasants! The true &amp;#34; success story &amp;#34; is the boss who hires the Burger flipper!	1
2076057	Won't let me play music or download. Wtf is with these music downloarders. HOW COME EVERYONE ELSE IS GOOD WITH THEM OTHER THAN ME?!	1
2078177	Hey guys I just got this today and I was not alert what I was about to find out. It told me to pay 3.99$ to start the game so I paid and then I start playing and it start skipping then it said to pay 4.00$ to finish the game. WTF I just paid!!!!! I pay again and then it say the game has stopped.  I went to it again and it gave me a black screen. I could not fix. And from that day I have no kindle anymore :(	1

Anyways, it's kinda addicting and I'm not a fan of the kardashians, but who cares. It's just a game. Why hate it just because it's kim kardashian? Willow pape is waaay worse than kim. If I encounter her one more time, I will throw this across the room.	4

After entering my email address and password I get a prompt &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; in the yellow &amp;#34;enter&amp;#34; square. When I procede NOTHING HAPPENS! When I try to make a comment I'm directed to sign in again, which, as I have just explained, I am unable to do. When I go to cnn.com from my web browser, things aren't much better. At least I can sign in but when commenting there is a delay from my typing to the appearance of the letters on the screen. This is very disconcerting  and time consuming. WTF, CNN!	1
2130583	This game is okay but it gets&quot;hung up&quot; too much and runs too slow. Wtf? I'm playing it and it stops and goes back to the title. I try to move across the&quot;campus&quot;and it snags. Why? The characters are walking and then they turn into a blank block.work on it....	2

I can post and stuff, but every time I am on my kindle, I keep getting system messages saying, Facebook installation failed.  Fix it, please!  I love staying connected with friends and family and Facebook allows it to be a daily connection.  If I lose that connection because you failed to fix the problem, I'll go elsewhere and I've been apart of FB for years, since it started.	2
2144696	Ok so I am going to keep the app but WTF it won't work for 0.9.0 hello fix it or I will delete  it	2

2149770	Okay game, but it is damn annoying, when it asks me to log into Facebook after every match. I don't want to connect to Facebook, Dammit! Stop asking me! Wtf. Another annoying point is it kept asking me to write this f-ing review... Here you go, an f-ing review.	3
2150952	So my Facebook won't open. Like it opens and then closes.... like WTF!!! This NEEDS to be fixed.. &gt;:( I don't know if you people have this problem too.	2

2155311	I'm also just doing this for the free 10 unique characters, but some of the characters like Mad Max or whatever talks in third person like Elmo and one calls you &amp;#34;sweetie&amp;#34; like wtf...	4

2157673	Would be great if you didn't need a cable subscription to watch. WTF! I thought network tv was free?	1
2166366	for some reason the app is lost from your device! I had almost 200,000 coins built up....and several levels gained.  An update from them was being installed and when I went back to the screen, the app was no longer in my device menu.  So I retrieved the app from my cloud and all my coins and levels were gone. WTF? All that time wasted to build up for nothing....what if I had 1,000,000 coins?  This stinks and I'm not going to waste my time earning coins and levels all over again!  Also, they give out coins for a 5 star review, which is a bribe.  So, do not believe all that you read because that review = coins takes place before you even play the game.	1
2167241	This game is by far the worst game I played, it has low quallity the com runs away halh of the time and the com is faster than u and whenever I try to attack my hits go through them WTF THIS GAME IS SUCKS	1

2197031	Clues were either way too easy or completely wtf.  There is no way to jump ahead and fill on the parts you know. You have to go in order. I got bored and deleted it after a day.	3
2200497	Good luck with getting a date with these gold digging chicks. Just like any other dating site 1. be a male model 2. be 10 foot 11 3. tons of flakes 4. good luck getting girls to talk to u... 5. to many fake profiles 6. uninstalled.<br /><br />I'm 5 foot 9<br />190 pounds<br />12% body fat<br /><br />I barely get emails and when I do all i get are fat women when I am 190 pounds of muscle, they be asking me do I like big girls? WTF!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Okay I'll try to keep this semi intelligent. I think I make a valid point here when I say, Women online suffer from an Absurd Standards Syndrome (ASS). The cyber female of today suffering from this ASS complex is a result of the fantastical 20 to 100 male to 1 female ratio at any given dating site. This on line ratio of dozens of males to each female on personals sites leaves women in a state of cyber induced self-delusion from so much attention from so many men they do not experience once they walk out their door into reality where the actual ratio is less than 1 male for every 1 female. Insulated by the PC media, glam mags, academia, beta suck-ups (manginas) and female friends, there are growing numbers of women posting personals on line losing touch with their rank relative to other women and are thus finding it easy to slip into this comfortable bubble of cyber self-delusion known as ASS. Similar to cigarette addiction, and the quick dopamine fix, many women found on personals sites are escaping a harsher acceptance of their personal flaws that can only be remedied by realizing the reality of their diminished mating choices in the real world after leaving their self-deluded comfort found in a multitude of attractive men that in all reality don't exist for them outside the confines of cyber space.<br /><br />Remedy to all this:<br /><br />1. Stay away from women under your league, and never settle.<br />2. Go to the gym.<br />3. Put on gear that fits.<br />4. Go the hell outside and chase women.<br />5. Stay the hell offline.'<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Go the hell outside and chase women. 5.

2202461	As a resize app it's just ok. It just shows filenames when selecting images, no thumbnails or previews, so if you have images named IMGXXXXX.jpg and don't know the exact one you need, then you are blindly resizing pics.<br />And what's with the permissions?<br />Location, network, accounts... WTF?<br />I have a firewall and app oops installed on my phone, so I was not worried about data leak when installed, I just needed to resize some photos, but again, it could be greatly improved...<br />If your phone is not rooted be wary of this app and its permissions	1
2205034	Wow.what were you thinking it is called backlip madness no free version it just crashes then downloads apps to your kindle wtf is wrong with you FOR MAKING A GAME THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND SAY THAT ITS YOURS JESUS CHRIST	1
2205583	IT WAS AMAZING I LOVED THE first episode, BUT I am really mad I MEAN IT FREAKING SAYS &quot;complete first edition&quot; leading you to think oh it is 100% free WITH ALL THE FREAKING EPISODES IT DOES NOT FREAKING SAY  DEMO OR FREE TRIAL IT JUST FREAKING DISHES OUT 1/5 of it and says complete first Damb season free rage face!!! AND WTF KINDLE WHY YOU NOT CARRY CAPS LOCK RAGE KING FACE!!!???!!!	3
2208071	I really enjoyed this game however after several weeks playing the game froze and I lost my 1.4 million in credits and the 48 levels I had achieved. WTF.  Contacted support several times and they never responded. Too bad, this game would have been a keeper.	1
2209745	Roarrrrrrrr I played the game it was so fun but then it said you SIX FRICKEN BUCKS TO BUY ONE STORY WTF REALLY PEOPLE JUST A GOOD FREE GAME FOR ONCE OMG.. but it was a good game	4
2210342	This game has some points of interest, but it's repetitive.  I've only played for maybe an hour total over almost two days.  That in itself is a testament to how interesting I found it.  If I find an interesting game I play 6 hours at the least for one day.<br /><br />The first time I played I didn't get what I was really doing.  They don't really have a good tutorial in regards to what the goal of the entire game is.  There are quests to complete in order to... I don't know yet.  I haven't completed 3 bosses yet so I don't know what comes after.<br /><br />The first two bosses are pretty easy, but the third is almost WTF.  When you reach the third boss you're pretty much SOL if you don't have shields or health available.  I've gotten to the third boss 5 times and really had no hope for survival because most of my blocks were arranged in just a couple two's, mostly lone blocks, or chunks of shield too big to be effective.<br /><br />There are multiple &#34;maps&#34; you can play but I don't know if different maps have different quests since I haven't purchased a map (with in game currency not in app purchasing so don't fear).<br /><br />At this point I'm not sure I'll pick up the game again.  If I do and manage to come to a better understanding of the whole point and like it I will change my review accordingly.	2
2216212	its ok but the clothes that they ask for I can't find anywhere. For example: the model janna in the 60' with the garters. wtf!! Where can I find garters	3
2226412	the latest update (last week or so) destroyed my use of this app in the car.<br />in the now playing screen, you used to ge able to swipe to go to next song, previous song.<br />this latest update has that functionality, but when you swipe it pops up a context menu.  WTF.<br />then you have to click out of that to close it, and then swipe to get to next song.<br /><br />super lousy bug.  that alone is causing me to look for another player.	1
2230733	There is absolutely no mention that this new Prime Music Application will not work with the 1st Generation Kindle Fire.  After screwing around with my Kindle for  hours I spent another hour on the phone talking a total of four people from Amazon before I was finally told &#34; your device is not compatible with this update and you need to buy a new Kindle&#34;.  WTF!!!!  I am very disappointed with Amazon and the deliberate omission of this piece of very important information.  If you are monitoring this Amazon, you dropped the ball and I will buy an Apple Ipad before I spend another dollar on any of your devices.	1
2236166	Really bad app it took 2 days to download WTF how do you take that long and second of all the app restarted again what happened I want to play this frikin game and you won't download very bad service very bad my apps usually download fast.	1

2261094	I contacted Kindle support 3 times and although all the reps helped the best they could , there is still no fix for printing from the Kindle Fire HDX to a dell printer.... WTF !	1
2276398	I spent 100 coins to eliminate letters. There was one more letter left than the blanks. Also, I would swear that I know the answer, but there is one one more blank than what I think the answer should be. WTF? And you can't skip a puzzle and go on. So, get stumped on one puzzle and you're done.	2
2277196	I lost my basketball a few weeks before this and just for fun I downloaded this and it told me follow I had no idea then me came scared me a bit then said outside I nervously stepped outside and tree I live next to the woods so I went to the edge of the tree line too scared to go farther it said rabbit I'm like WTF and to the left a rabbit goes by so I follow that and about 10 minutes later I find my ball this TOTALLY works	5
2278577	relys way to much on you buying crystals to buy the awesome gun or armor you just saw.So it's either spend 69.99 on one purchase or just turn away sadly looking to the scrappy weapons or armor that cost only coins and even then your going to have to spend 99.99 on more coins for a weapon that is cool that costs coins so your hopeful then you look at how many coins it costs probably 2,999,999 coins for one weapon wtf?	1
2289114	crashes before it can begin .. used to be occasional .. then almost every game ... now it crashes as soon as it opens .. installed, removed and reinstalled a dozen times (not exaggerating) .. wtf? !?!?!?	1

2300085	are you kidding me?! its just a demo?!? wtf! ugh. don't get this game unless you only want to play for 5 minutes.):	1
2300750	I had really enjoyed playing this on my Kindle Fire HD. I actually played before work this morning. When I tried to play after work a message popped up that there have been upgrades. I followed the link and downloaded the upgrade but still can not play. I'm STILL getting the upgrade message with the link to do it. I'm more than a little ticked off. WTF?? Nice upgrade!	1
2305603	Wtf is this dumb game when you first start you frickin sloce a rat with a bent knife or something then they you back whith there retchet knife back and forth back and forth...... and mainly your a frickin person on a card fighting other things on a card..... wtf you call that a game total rip off for me	1
2314994	My opinion to this?!?!?!<br />So i normally use my kindle EVRY DAY FOR HOURS untill my battery runs out and i saw how my sisters phone saves a lot of battery so i get this app<br />I have 89% and with tht i normally had 4 hours to use my kindle also it inclues (full light) and now i get this app<br />It says i get 18 hours and 5 minutes<br />Like WTF<br />THATS SO FREAKING AWESOME	5
2316224	"...it can only be installed onto my Android phone -- not onto my new Kindle Fire HDX 7\\"". When I go to purchase the app, my (2014) Kindle Fire HDX 7\\"" is X'd out, meaning it is not compatible. I am able to download and install the Redbox Instant by Verizon app, but not the regular Redbox app. WTF?!?! Unless I have an active Redbox Instant account (with an $8 monthly fee), then this app does me no good to check on movies available at a local kiosk in my area or to find out which movies I've already rented or to reserve a movie (or movies) for pickup, which are the reasons why the regular Redbox app is needed. I don't care about the Redbox Instant by Verizon app since I do not have an active account. What gives, Amazon? The app description says it is compatible with the Kindle Fire, even Redbox's website says it is available for the Kindle Fire devices. What gives?!?! So disappointed. The app would have been 5 stars for my Android phone, but only 1 star for my Kindle Fire HDX tablet, thus the middle rating of 3 stars."	3
2317607	The app itself it not bad, quite well done as a matter of fact...have it on my Ipad.  Fairly nice graphics and enjoyable game play.<br />BUT....<br /><br />Android app that is not compatible with Android device=WTF!  Chalk up another win for the Apple in the Ipad vs. Kindle battle.<br /><br />Why does Amazon even offer this app if you can't use it on their own device?	1
2318374	When I was playing I fell in love with it but then I started noticing that even if you don't hit the white you doe because I hit the black and I died so I said wtf! Like I didn't hit the white then I through my phone at the wall but oh well	3

2321172	My galaxy 5 has been downloading this for weeks. Every time it finishes it just starts over, without ever finishing the install. Granted, it isn't the developers fault that it isn't downloading correctly.  I'm just fed up because I have no way to stop the cycle! Every time I connect to WiFi it starts trying again. I can't Uninstall something that never installed and there is not &amp;#34;stop download&amp;#34; option . Wtf amazon.....I even paid to visit this inferior app market. I'm sticking with Google	1

2337233	I bought this app because i read an article that said it was now available on my fire TV. And there was a bonus of Amazon coins for buying it. I bought it, and got my coins but couldn't get it delivered to my Fire TV. Despite the fact that on the buy page it says that it is compatible with my Fire TV. WTF? Thankfully I have HDX from my work so I have a place to play but I would not have bought this title if I hadn't read that it would work on my Fire TV.<br /><br />UPDATE: I was able to get this on my Fire TV as of Friday, it just appeared. Which is great. But I wasn't able to find a way to join the social club which should allow me to get my game progress from the HDX. Looking for that so I don't have to redo all the progress I have accomplished on the other device.	1
2337350	Don't waste your time trying to get to 1999 coins so you can buy a special costume like the snowpou. Once I got to 1999 coins, I bought the costume, it took away the coins, but then a there was a pop-up that titled &quot;Not enough coins&quot; then suddenly it was 5999 coins. Wtf?! I wasted a ton of my time getting that much money, and now I'm left with two coins, because they took away my coins anyway. **DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS**	2

2354194	I downloaded this game as the FAOD and played it a little while. It was a decent puzzle game. Then I left it alone. Suddenly this morning, I received the following notification: &amp;#34;Mummy's Treasure &mdash; We miss your epic puzzle skills.. Play Now!&amp;#34; WTF, FizzPow? This is totally unacceptable for an app to do, ever. There isn't even an option to disable it in the settings, short of doing so at the Android OS level. Uninstalled.	1
2358076	I paid for this twice. Once for my phone, and now for my Kindle Fire.  On  my Kindle, there  are no &#34;Game Options&#34; in the Settings!  WTF???	1

2361290	I love this game it is so cool. but the only thing that is creepy about it is suicide. I mean come on suicide? the first time I saw this I was thinking WTF. but I'll have to live with it. just don't be freaked out  when you see it. ok? this app is awesome but not suicide bye have a great day.	5
2362275	I really liked the game. It's fun and flexes my creativity. I've had it for only less than a week and I was already enjoying it.<br /><br />Then, one day, I opened up the game only to find all of my progress had been lost.<br /><br />A big WTF to that! I got almost done with the entire second level only to go straight back to the beginning. If the game weren't so fun, I would give it less stars.<br /><br />All I'm saying is; once they fix this problem, I might actually get back to playing it again. I mean, what's the point if you have to start all over again?	3
2364795	After I updated the app videos won't play. It will play for a second, freeze and kick me out of the app WTF &gt;_&lt;	1
2369201	So I'm at the first part and I can't put it on her hair I'm like wtf so I try again and again and again I'm freaking out I hate this app DONT GET IT	1
2371617	This worked fine for 4 weeks then all of a sudden today my phone notifies me it's spyware. Must have been corrupted somehow. But wtf? 4 weeks of progress notes lost. Bummed.	1
2374531	Ok so obviously androids and kindles are using th app because if you could get the real piano tile app u would. this Sucks because wvery time I open the app iit freezes or is a black screen like wtf?	1
2375163	No words to describe the awesomeness but there is one problem wtf are all these guns mettle pipes knives and weapons doing in a jail.	5
2378630	For a paid app, there sure is a lot of ads.  In addition, bunches of popups pushing IAP.  Permissions to my camera?  WTF is that?  Do NOT buy!	1

2382700	I give this a 3 star because he's CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE. But the 2- says are for reality. A cute little box with arm and legs helping sleepwalking birds get to a locked door that unlocks with the bird. Really. WTF. so there you have it . Also it starts gettin hard. NOW that's it. BUH BAI :3	3
2382705	The dragons start off cute and become cool. Currently lv 12 with dragons averaging around 16.<br />Got really into but here's my gripe: The Arena is broken. As in, if you're playing for free, you are NOT gonna enjoy it. I'm currently on an 11 win streak as a f2p player. The reward for my 12 win in a row would be a gold coin. Whereas it would be awesome for free players, BUT, once you get that much of a win streak, I'm getting matched up with lv 60+ players! It's impossible for me, the players are all lv 60-120, with a 5 dragon team, I'm level 12 with 3 baby dragons, wtf? The dragons are all lv 80+ as well. Not cool. I'm gonna just cry off that gold coin. T.T Hope you're reading this playzen!	3
2383165	It's a great.game. Not understanding why the snow piles with the money stopped showing up after I got the mission to collect them. Wtf? Plz fix this so I can collect the reward	4
2383478	I got this faotd to past time. I have no kids but nieces nephews. I don't see how this is appropriate for all ages. Level 30 animals 1st clue is two types of genitalia WTF!	3
2390154	For some reason my app closed on me and now it's says try again later wtf!!!!! It been a whole day I love this app but fix this at least hey if u can do good on phones and tablets and Xbox then you can at least do this for a supporter of this app	5
2393095	Awful graphics, weird setup for shooting, and drop off into the sky when you enter a building and then no way to get back,wtf? Worst game I've downloaded in a long time	1
2395324	The new set up isnt convenient, its annoying. I also cant upload pics from my kindle fire or use the big emojis. Wtf? -_-	3
2401277	I used to love this game but wtf happened I stopped playing for a while then I go back on and it says there's a WiFi problem but my WiFi is fine	1
2401515	all this app does is frame your picture nothing great about it and then the worse part is that it stretches the picture all yhu do is pick a frame really someone please tell me wtf is this I kno wat it is a waste of my time.	1
2402441	DO NOT GET IT, YOU WOULD BE WASTING YOUR TIME!<br />It's absolutely horrid, I got it because I &lt;3 Creepypasta and Slender is like the boss of Creepypasta but when I got it I scanned my right thumb 4 times, Michael Myers (I think that's his name, I really don't care though) came up...then I did it again with my LEFT thumb and Freddy Kruger (once again, I think) came up! Then with my index fingers Chucky (again, not sure) came up!!! Wtf?!?!	1
2402485	This is one of my favorite games for mobile devices. I bought this Kindle to play this game on a larger screen and to have a better experience. My friend has an older kindle and can play no problem. This game, and many others aren't compatible with the newer kindle. The available game selection for new kindle is total garbage! WTF!!!! I find games daily that I would like to play but can not on my new store bought device. PLEASE do something about the pathetic game selection for Kindle Fire HD.	1
2412604	(Note 3)  first of all adds. Wtf do I need to see adds I pay money so I dont have to se adds. Can't even play force close. Hope to see it improved so I can see what its like. And adds removed. Or make it a free app.	1
2418316	Today's update SUCKS!I don't want to see posts from last week! It should automatically be set to MOST RECENT, top stories are old news! Way to make my previous 4 stars into a 1 star rating. I could deal w the change w no prob if I could see what I want as soon as I get on. Instead I have to search around just to get to most recent stories, wtf is wrong w your designers, do they not want good ratings or something?! FIX it!	1
2418784	do not dolwand because u only get 3 pictures!  wtf? that is stupid anand the rest u have to pay!  guys don't buy it u will regret it okay ; I'm happy it was free cause it not worth it of any money or any energy to dolwanding this app; I'm going detle it!  so dum!  can belive amazon bring this app; get pic college!	2

2459723	The app doesn't open on my Kindle<br />WTF<br />Glad I gave you money !<br />No stars if they would let me	1
2463277	So we pay quite a bit to AWS per month... Yet due to geo location we are not allowed to download the AWS authenticator?<br />WTF...	1
2465011	I give this app one big WTF star,  for being completely useless.  My child has the Real Steel HD game and loves it, especially after watching the movie.  So he saw this and wanted it on his kindle,  I immediately had to take it off.  It doesn't let you even play the game,  it just streams ad banner after ad banner.	1
2465405	It says there is a new update and it takes me there and there ain't no new update now I cnt login wtf ugh! =-=	1
2469672	brakes in this game, make you go BACKWARDS and one time, I was just standing there thinking of how to knock over a tree when I died cause I ran out of gas! wtf is up with that!	2
2470433	I've bee using this app for 2-3 years and was happy with it until the so called upgrade. This new version, while glitzier, is buggy. Sometimes works, sometimes won't connect to my network. Also the previous version allowed you see TV schedules several days into the future; I can't find how to do that now and the channel filtering is more laborious. I'm giving 3 stars because when it works it's okay but as it is it's way too undependable in this new iteration. If all the kinks are worked out I'll edit this review. However, since the old version worked so well why can't they just 'downgrade' back to it (or 'upgrade' back to the old version)?<br /><br />To top it all off I tried the 'Contact Us' button. It asked for my email address as was expected. What was not expected was asking for my email password - wtf!!! To say the least I aborted my attempt at contact. Seemed like an attempt at phishing or ID theft to me.<br /><br />4-7-14 UPDATE: I found the feature that allows you to see future schedules but only for one particular channel at a time. In order to see future schedules you must tap on each individual channel. Again, cumbersome and laborious. Also when I opened the program today I found all OTA channels listed - not filtered for my channels. Oh boy, how long is it going to take to get it right??!!! Have downgraded to two stars.	2
2475735	I was playing the game and loving it so much, but then I wanted to look at the other games there were and noticed you had to unlock them. so I was like wtf... but other than that I liked it.	4
2481160	I started on Facility so I walked down the path and started shooting at a guy and didn't do anything but he shot at me and killed me. WTF???	1
2485626	Really like the games on here. There are many different types so you never burn out on one certain kind. I have not spent any money and have played over 185 hours...  the game has been running smoothly even with the updates. Today, however, it keeps shutting down on me when I try to access the pics. I think I'm on a new level where everything locked back up again but for like 3k coins and 10 energy points I could unlock them. I've only been able to open and unlock 2 pics... every other one crashes my program.  Than I noticed ALL my collections and stuff were gone!?!?!?##@$@!##  wtf!!!!  I am a so upset. It took a long time and a lot of friends help getting my stuff!  I am so disappointed and I'm wondering if it's payback for not spending money....  I hope not...	4
2489238	First time I played this I was like wtf!?! The bird poops!! It was just plain weird well not as weird as pewdiepie but pretty weird.	5
2489256	I don't know what this even is....is it supposed to be a game of some kind,like really wtf....it's honestly useless don't get it	1
2495125	I Purchased the Pro version of  the Schedule Planner App by Upgrading in-App but I got it at the Amazon App Store and paid with 399 Amazon Coins.  When my Kindle Fire 2 died and I got a Kindle Fire HD.  My apps were retrieved from the Amazon cloud  on my KFHD only the free version was there, I was u9nable to use any Pro features and The App maker Intersog says its Amazons responsibility but Amazon says I have to contact Intersog .  I have an Amazon Receipt for paying for  Schedule Planner Pro (which I actually liked) and to sent it to Intersog but they said they could not  tell if i bought it in-app or from app store so they couldn't help, WTF?!? Beware of upgrading Apps in App, I guess its better to purchase Pro version from Amazon App Store and hope your info syncs.	2
2496286	So I been using this app for a while and it worked perfectly but then I tried getting on and it said gamefly stopped working and I was like ok ill try again and it said the same thing so I turn off my kindle and turn it back on same thing so I checked my internet connection it was 5 bars I've literally checked everything so then i tried it again still no I was like wtf!!!	2
2504279	Okay, the game is the most addicting game I've ever played, but I purchased 6 dollars worth of them to try my luck on some algebraic chests since the was a blue planes event going on were you can get really awesome an  rare blue  plane cards but anyways it took my money and I didn't get the gems. WTF! It says I nee  to reinstall the game but I'm afraid that it'll delete all my saved data an  I will have to start over. If they fix this and give me my gems then I will rate this game 5 stars.	4
2504810	IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT. I had no issues before. Now, won't connect to server, sync with Facebook and had to start over. Now I can't even play, server error. WTF! Played all day yesterday until the update window popped up. Rating before, 5 stars. Rating now, not even a 1. Haven't read any explanations either. Please be professional and respond, fix and compensate to you users.	1
2507726	Win to loss rate stinks. Every time you level up you loose it fast. This truly is a Las Vegas (aka Lost Wages) style game. Description states Mature...WTF...what's mature about a girl in a large toga? No leg, no cleavage; and no side (  &middot; Y &middot; ).  Even though the app is free I WAS ROBBED!	2
2509145	If u can fast click ok then u can play. If not it will put u in a never ending loop of ads when u start game..... wtf creators one once in awhile is good enough but cuz this im uninstalling	2
2509403	I recently started listening to this podcast when I learned about it through another great show, WTF with Marc Maron. I enjoy and recommend this conversation style interview that puts the subject at ease while they hold an hour plus chat. Aisha is intelligent and witty and seems to genuinely enjoy conversing with her subjects. The app itself works without a hitch. Since the developer also does Maron's podcast I know the hardest thing I'll have to do is clear the cache 1-2 times per year.	5
2510391	Interrupted my game and said I need to update... click OK, and it sends me to the store where there is no &#34;update&#34; option... wtf!!!??? Click on the buy button and it tells me I already have the game...go to the game, even turned tablet off and back on, but when the game comes back up, same message... vicious circle!!! What's the problem???	1
2510894	The main reason I purchased this app is to cast to my TV using Google's Chromecast. I love the Plex media server (PMS) and together with this app it makes the Chromecast worth it and useful. I can cast all my personal video, music, and photos to my TV.<br /><br />But the Chromecast casting feature has what I consider a major flaw, which is that it does not cast the content of your library as you are browsing on your phone. Only after you select a particular movie then it casts the movie info to the Chromecast. Why is it a serious flaw you may ask, since you are looking at the content on the phone? Because if you have friends and family and you are browsing to select a movie it is very inconvenient. Everyone wants you to give them the phone so they can see what's available. When one chooses a movie the info is display on tv, then someone else will say let's watch something else and wants the phone to browse for another movie or show, and so on. I mean WTF? What is the one thing Plex Media Server has on the other guys like Tversity, etc.? Its user interface. The ways it organizes your movies and tv shows. I want the same interface cast to the Chromecast. When that happens I will give it 5 stars.	3
2511586	Won't let me install, keeps giving me an error message, I paid for it and can't return wtf? Not sure what to do	1
2514542	This game is just locking of a lot of things. First its all fun then all of a sudden all break loose. First it lags majorly, the scratch part of it if you won something it won't give ur price but if u loses it takes ur card (wtf). And three consecutive game in a raw no Mark cards nothing I mean even at least one Mark (odd). And the winning countdown omg urban don't see any1 winning all of the sudden the game is done! I won't play this crap until is fix or something	1
2518271	The game is amazing... but as of late I will almost win the mission, then the damn thing will freeze! Not just a crash no... game will keep going, but will not respond to controls! WTF??? I almost destroy the tank or kill a rival, then no controls and death... if I could rate in the negatives, I would give it as low as possible	1
2526703	every time I start the game it's upside down. When I turn my device the game turns again still playing upside down on the screen. Wtf???<br />KFHDX<br /><br />After locking the screen to keep it from playing upside down, it was actually a pretty fun game. I love these myster type point and tap type games. There were non of those annoying search games with that list of things you have to find. The only other issue I had was getting stuck trying to find a test tube. Spoiler, there is a hallway on the second floor that was not easily noticable. If i remember my rooms, it's inbetween the kids room and bathroom. Other than that, I loved the challange of trying to figure my way through the house. Hopefully a second story will soon follow.	4
2530792	when I saw this game I was like wtf? I downloaded it and it turned AMAZING!!! If you love Juan cat this is a must get.	5
2535544	I have had all sorts of problems with this game from missing inventory to glitches that allow stronger players an unfair advantage over others. Once I report the problem(s), I get a confirmation email, then a general email giving problem solving instructions that have absolutely nothing to do with my problem. The email with general instructions ask that is that does not resolve your problem them reply directly to the email. Once I replied to tell them there instructions didn't resolve my problem, then I receive another email immediately telling me the case has been closed and to make another report of the problem. WTF!!! Also, no update for android platform give other players an unfair advantage in troops and resources. Don't spend your time or your money on this game. I promise, you will end up screwed and not happy!	1
2537188	What's the point of the game? I mean WTF its a complete waste of money and time, oh did I mention WASTE of MONEY. The graphics suck the game sucks the whole thing has no point. Don't buy it, heck don't download the free version. If I could give no stars that's what the game would get.<br />P.S. If you don't buy it that's money SAVED.	1
2540145	Was actually searching for WTF Pictures, but this was the only option... Nowhere near as iinteresting, but I guess it'll do in a pinch for free... ;-)	1
2550878	"And maybe even if you do!  Even the \\""geeks\\"" [stupid word when not referring to Ozzie Osbourne] at avast! use it if you give them access to your computer.  I had avast! on my first or second gen Kindle Fire, but eventually it began asking for a PIN to connect it to my avast! account.  Since I'm practically kin to avast!, I called and asked WTF.  In too big a hurry to bother with the details of why the app didn't (as in WOULDN'T) work in my Fire (may have had something to do with Amazon, but I ain't claimin' nuttin!), I uninstalled it (had to improvise that!) and downloaded the best freeware anti-virus/ anti-pup software I've found (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GT4V5DM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_)1.  (I keep a Win 7 Forum version of this program on my laptop as well, but run it only if I want to dig more deeply into my incoming than avast! will dig unless I go into the sub-menus and set its controls for the heart of the sun.)  Have not yet checked whether Amazon offers a paid version of Malwarebytes for Kindle that does more than the free version does, but a paid version for laptops does exist (I haven't paid for the full version for laptop, but will reconsider when my avast! subscription runs out).  I excuse my slowness to investigate this by asking how much trouble a first-gen Fire can get into, anyway.  Yes, I recommend this program with my whole head and part of my heart!"	5
2555623	I love this game. This game i  hella fun and now am an addict of minecraft like Lindsay Lohan is an addict on drugs! Just ONE problem, they don't have any GIRL skins. WTF why are there no GIRL skins for minecraft?! That is so sexist don't think that girls aren't gonna play minecraft. Other than that, MINECRAFT IS AWESOME!	5
2555886	.........my world is gone ............wtf<br />Everything i worked on........It's gone it was the best game ever and it just bugged and .......is gone	2
2559718	It won't work at all. I choose something to play and it won't play it. And eventually something popped up saying &quot;we're sorry but music choice is not for this device&quot;...wtf?? o_O	1
2561678	I was looking forward to playing the rain forest sound, but it plays only for a couple of minutes then stops, you have to keep pushing the play button.. wtf???<br />no good.	1
2563547	This app doesn't work good at all every time I click on Facebook it loads an then goes off of the app like wtf!!	1
2565743	I scared my BFF/ my bro SO GOOD!!!! They screamed like little girls!!!!! wtf peeps?<br />I didn't know how girlish you were!!! XD more like whoever invented this is NUTZ!!!!!!!#frikin  awesome	4
2568254	As much as I adore a bargain on high end merchandise, I can not recommend My Habit to you, sister!<br /><br />Yes the merch looks adorable, but if you live within a 100 miles of a Bloomingdales or Nordstrom, do yourself a favor, suck it up, drive to the mall and look for these brands on the sales rack.<br /><br />Merchandise<br />It looks great online but often times is cheaply made with inferior materials, or is more akin to seconds with crooked seams, upside down labels or wrong length sleeves.  There is so much variety in the shoes that I have bought (men's Pumas and women's cork clogs) they are either just what you expect of &#34;WTF&#34; uncomfortable, cheap knock-offs of a more popular brand.  What is baffling to me is that the &#34;original&#34; pricing for the cheap stuff is so high.<br /><br />Shipping<br />Again, wild inconsistencies abound.  You get your orders either in mere days, or in my case, 3 weeks from your date of purchase.  Items can sometimes be shipped together or are piece-mealed.  There is no rhyme of reason.  And as far as tracking... good luck with that!<br /><br />Value<br />You really enter a grey area when buying products here.  There is no value or bargain in an uncomfortable poorly constructed pair of shoes... no matter how sassy they look. On the other hand, if you want that LAMB tunic you saw last season marked down 40%... then go for it.<br /><br />Returns<br />No problem here. Well, you do get charged a nominal fee for returns... but it is easy to do and is better than a retail &#34;walk of shame&#34; when returning an item to a bricks and mortar store.	2
2568619	Like wtf I want to see my person not a phone DAMN is that too much to ask<br />Like DAMN fix that	5
2569563	I loved the PS3 version and was curious to see how it would look on the Fire HD.<br />After it installed I noticed it wouldn't start, and it had started to download again (an update already??).. then after the second full installation it worked. All was well.<br /><br />Day 2: The Kindle Fire started bugging out like it was possessed. The keyboard would appear and disappeared in rapid succession. When I checked the notifications I saw The Walking Dead was downloading yet again... another 500MB+.. all day long this kept popping up and downloading The Walking Dead!!! As soon as it finished it would start up again.. It would slow down the Kindle along with other issues..<br /><br />Day 3: I power on the Kindle Fire HD and guess what pops up.. The Walking Dead is downloading...WTF?!?! I had it with this app.. &quot;DELETE&quot;.. remove from Kindle, Remove from Cloud. GOOD RIDDANCE.<br /><br />Day 4: The Walking Dead is back on my Kindle' s app list. I thought I was through with this app, but it seems they were not through with me! I delete it again, power off, power back on and it starts to download again, slowing down and eventually locking up everything in the process.<br /><br />In short, this app is a VIRUS and should be eradicated and left for dead.<br /><br />TellTaleGames better fix this and make it right for Kindle owners. From what I've heard the only way to fix this now and remove it is to reformat the Kindle and start over, losing many game saves and bookmarks in the process. I really don't want to do this.	1
2570326	It's ok. Some are easy while others are completely wtf. For example there is a picture of jeans that I have no clue about. Oh well	4
2570567	WTF WTF WTF WTF I KILL ALL U BI***ES U ALL DEAD IN THIS GAME IT IS F***IN AMAZING SO GET IT IT IS WORTH IT $$<br />  |__| &infin;&trade;&copy; ALL RIGHTS RESERVED	5
2574745	I bought a season pass through this developer and downloaded episode 2 and 400 days. I played episode 2 last night and when I went to download episode 3 it tried to tell me to purchase it! As a matter of fact it tells me to purchase episode 3,4, and 5! WTF? If this does not get resolved I wouldn't recommend this game but it is fun to play on the kindle and graphics are good but till I get this resolved I only give one star.	1
2577489	total copy of flappy bird. wtf it poops ew its disgusting and just boring. blah blah blah idk i just hate it... dont get it flappy bird was so much better.	1
2581007	Installed the game and barely had anything built, got attacked the same day...WTF?<br />The game kept closing out when I tried to open it up. Let it go a couple days thinking it would get better...it didn't and I uninstalled.	1
2581393	Entering an event takes twice as long as it should because it changes my spelling to a totally unrelated bizarre word!  For example the town of Charlevoix becomes Charleston, Charlotte and I forget what else before it finally accepts the correct spelling.  Timberdoodle becomes Timberlake!  Babe's becomes baker's!  WTF!  If there is a way to disable the spell check, I have not discovered it.	3
2585228	What?<br />Kindle Fire HD of 13 months is better than current HDX version, so WTF?<br />I have had the android version side loaded from 1Mobile since day one, but it would be better if we KFHD users didn't have to do that. I love my KFHD, but based on lessons learned like this, next time around I'll be getting a more widely supported regular android tablet so my apps can be current and I don't have to go extra steps and jump through hoops to see if they will run on a sometimes yes and sometimes no hybrid android operating system like my KFHD.<br />Very irritated at both DISH and AMAZON over this app that that's not available for my KFHD at the Amazon app store.<br />Sometimes it seems both companies have numb skulls working just to anger their customers.<br />Love the quality of their products - dislike the genius that comes up with such nonsense (must be Dilbert's boss).	1
2600802	It acts like it will install but then it says that it needs to be updated manually and switches to the update screen and it's nowhere to be seen!!! Wtf!!!!	1
2603046	Well when I first saw this game I was like WTF is this carp but then I started playing it OMG it is the best game in the world!!!	5
2620956	I got this app a year ago and now it's saying its not available to be in my country WTF???	3
2631371	Okay, so I download this stupid &amp;#34;Talking Angela&amp;#34; thing and the next thing  I know I'M BEING STALKED. Like seriously it's asking me do u have a boyfriend, like wtf?!?!?! Then I &amp;#34;convinced&amp;#34; my bff to get this app FOR ACCIDENT and once I found out that this stupid app is EVIL AND SCARY I HAD to tell my bff to UNINSTALL THIS STUPID FREAKING APP. And even tho I uninstalled it I still feel like I'm being stalked... AND I LIKE UNINSTALLED THIS A WEEK AGO. I found this out by reading the ratings and by the news a girl died becuz of dis app. And this is what I heard from my other friends they said a hacker hacked the password thing and the company can't delete the app and if u have a camera on ur phone or any electronic UNINSTALL THIS GAME RIGHT NOW SERIOUSLY IT TAKES PICTURES OF U AND THE STALKER WILL MURDER U. Btw I hope the STALKER DOESN'T READ THIS!!!! D:	1
2632718	I love playing this game on my son's Kindle Fire, but on my Galaxy S4 I am required to play it in advanced mode (and there's no way to change that), plus the game crashes often. I had gotten all the way to the last level and it crashed and wiped out all the progress I'd made. I had to start all over again. I have removed, downloaded and reinstalled this app, and now it's worse.  Now the first two levels have golden crowns on them and the rest are locked. WTF?!	2
2635814	This game was doin great till they messed up speedups im stuck in battle que with 20m powr my whole army outside the gates cant come home and on seperate que lost 10k bowmen mailed customer service 5 or 10 times throughout the day and still no action has been takin wtf really<br />tap4fun?	1
2636491	Be  careful on this particular app cuz when I downloaded it then this banner comes up to the screen and says BIG BROTHER IS watching  WTF THEN the thing screen had a strange look literally there where two eye just looking right at you on every page I got on it really. Creepy me out since and I can't wipe the thing clean and I had to order a new kindle and there sending me new one free of charge so be careful what you download I know I will.	1
2639172	Took 2 hours to get to 20% then fails, wtf, then now it just stays on zero.....You need to fix this an this game would skyrocket into success...lots of other downloading comments same problem:/	3
2641970	I can't even download this on my kindle tablet! It even says kindle tablet edition! Wtf!?!?!?!?<br /><br />I thought this was kindle tablet edition! I would give this 0 stars if I could!	1
2642597	This app is very stupid...I tried to post pics of myself and they got rid of them because I'm not hot.....wtf!?!?	1
2642647	IT WON'T LOAD WTF WASTE OF MONEY TIME &amp;YOUR LIFE DO NOT GET WASTE OF MONEY PEOPLE HONESTLY IT SUCKS	1
2643943	She says she is 18  but she  drink beers  I am like wtf dude . Also it is CREEPY like she asks your name and where you live and she asks do you have any sisters or brothers. Also  there's  a face cam so she can watch you. And it  does  not work for kidle fire.	1
2644176	OK IM JUST BEIN HONEST BUT IT WAS WORKIN FINE AT FIRST BUT ON MY KINDLE WHEN I HAD TO REINSTALL IT IT SAID I WASNT ELIGIBLE.WTF!!!!!!	2
2645610	This is effecting my world arms game because it wants me to install and play and you don't even have this running WTF that makes sense right. Customer service for gameloft is the worst I've ever experienced	1
2645624	This is a very good game but every time I play a game I'm level 4 and it matches me up with a level 122 player?! I mean wtf man!!!	3
2649267	I loved this on Dreamcast, but please tell me how you go from a game that consumed less than 1GB storage in its original form (GD-ROM was a max size of 1GB) to this bloated mess?! The main download takes ~750MB and goes into /system/app. It then requires you to have an additional 1.3GB of internal /mnt/sdcard storage to complete the install.<br /><br />WTF SEGA?!<br /><br />I can't review this game unless I first remove every other app from my device (Hisense Sero 7 Pro).	1
2654823	Really fun game BUT when I got to World 3 Level 1 when the level  starts Lep just falls through the ground and I die before I even get a chance to move WTF?	3
2657774	I Love playing this game on my computer but my computer doesn't work anymore so I was like why don't I just download it.And I did but it took forever to download!! 5 minutes later,it's not even at 1 percent!! I'm like wtf man.But I still love this game. :)	3
2660646	Edit: I contacted the developer and they fixed the problem the next day.<br /><br />Wtf? It was a fun game. Great time waster. Then, in the middle of game play, I got a porn ad in a Stupid Zombies browser type window.<br />Uninstalled & lost all my progress. Reinstalled and still have the porn ads!<br />I took screen shots to send the developer. Wtf!	5
2662743	just bought this, downloaded it and it just says.. can not open file... wtf?! keep trying it says downloaded but no icon is created and no way to start the game... I am becaming very frustrated with my first non free app!<br /><br />update... icon created... still not able to download application.<br /><br />I finally just gave up and deleted the app. I've yet to check my bank statment but I am pretty sure the charge ent through without a hitch.	1
2663116	Not a happy camper.  Just spent two hours editing and tweaking a picture of proposed modifications for my car.  It looked great.  I press done.  And it says 'Applying edit X of Y'.  I walk away to get a drink.  Come back to the screen black.  Turn it on.  No file was saved.  I have wasted an entire night.<br /><br />WTF program stops saving an edited photo when your screen turns off?!?  Can't save in the background or disable screen power saver while saving?  Seriously?<br /><br />I don't know how to use Photoshop and I did this entire thing by hand on my PHONE!  Do you realize how tedious that is?<br /><br />I'd have rated one star but for the fact that I can get the results I want.  If you know how I can recover that photo or return my life, I would appreciate it.	2
2663877	This game is a ripoff it's so stupid castle clash is sooooooooo much better also when you have left over people from your victorys they get rid of them WTF is up with this s***	1
2666178	I don't have time to watch the Olympics live, and my husband and I &#34;cut the cord&#34; and don't belong to a cable company anymore (we get by with basic cable, hulu and netflix) and so I thought this app would solve all my problems; I would be able to watch what I wanted, when I wanted. WRONG. First of all, they make you sign in to your account before you can watch. Well what if you don't have a cable provider? Guess you have to use a &#34;temporary pass&#34; that's only good for 30 minutes of screen time. Screw that. So I decide to use my parents direcTV sign in, but every time I hit the &#34;sign in&#34; button and it lists my cable options and I hit &#34;DirectTV&#34; it takes me back to the sign in page. WTF? And then, when I wanted to watch Meryl Davis and Charlie White skate to their gold I had to fast forward on my tablet for four hours. Usually easy. Except EVERY TIME YOU MOVE IT FORWARD YOU HAVE TO WATCH A SET OF COMMERCIALS. So move it forward, check to see which skating couple they're showing, watch three commercials. Move it forward, watch commercials. So I spent about 15 minutes watching the same coke ad. And when I tried to do any of this on my galaxy s4 the app gave me the ever so vague &#34;network connection error&#34;. Do not download, you will hate your life when trying to watch this thing.	1
2678368	This game is pretty good for a kindle game, and coming from me...that's really good because I am a hardcore gamer who seeks out the best games.<br /><br />I only have 2 complaints: 1) This would be really great if the WEAPONS...weren't so FRICKEN EXPENSIVE!...2) I had $467,331.00 and 14 diamonds. I went to buy a gun that cost 8 diamonds..and when I bought it..I lost almost all of my money too! WTF is up with that! 8 diamonds does not mean 8 diamonds AND $430,000.00!!!! Da Hell Freyer!!	4
2680338	It's fun, but can aggravating at times leaving wondering wtf that word had to do with the picture.  Still fun.  Huge satisfaction when you figure out the tough ones.	5
2682306	Very time I get to the pipe thing it don't go through it fall and dies like ... wtf so that's my report on the dumb game and I don't think u should download it !	2
2689112	Ok first you cant choose over 6 options of your character<br /><br />Next the wardens arrest you for pissing in the floor<br /><br />Next wardens are op<br /><br />Next wtf m dickie	1
2695120	Whenever I try to get my daily reward an advertisement pops up and I'm fine with that. So I clicked the `X` but another advertisement pops up I'm like wtf? So I click the `X` again and another advertisement pops up!! Immediately deleted this game from my device.	1
2697708	Overall I love the game itself, but there are a few issues that need fixing in the paid version.<br /><br />1. They require internet access and pop up ads anyway, which makes it so I can't leave my kids unsupervised playing it.<br /><br />2. There aren't as many blades and backgrounds to unlock as in the free version. Wtf?<br /><br />3. With the update they pushed through last night the developers took away the ability to earn new blades and backgrounds by performing tasks in game. They make you buy them all with fruit points now.<br /><br />If they fix these pieces of stupidity I'll give them 5 stars, but not before.	1
2698721	It was great for a while then I got really far and it uninstalled itself I connected it to Facebook and every thing!! The only thing I got back when I turned it on was a restart. But one thing it did save was how my character looked. All . The money I spent wasted all the time . I spent wasted!!! WTF is this!!!	1
2698971	I love it it has great graphics and opinions to use and its all free I LOVE IT because when I saw it I said WTF it's so COOL!!!	5
2710000	Unfortunately I downloaded this before reading the reviews. However, after reading the top review &amp; before I tried playing it, I simply deleted it because it sounded too risky. I should have never downloaded it in the first place. Immediately my Kindle began acting up, running extremely slow &amp; crashing. Now I have a few apps that will not even open. I don't know WTF this game has done to my Kindle, but it's practically unusable now. I've had my Kindle for a year &amp; have never had a problem with it before now. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!	1
2714051	Love this game keeps me playing with all the stuff you can upgrade and customize but ,, it drops connection and won't pick back up for hours I can play other games and Everthing so it's not my device ,, this is a major problem what if you can only play at current times and it's connection is loss and won't pick up wtf ,,,,fix this and will love this game ,	3
2719772	This game will not download on my kindle fire hd 7 gets to 100% and says download failed! Wtf ripoff!!!	1
2725644	Great game but the dog you can get it was a little to much gold skulls I mean 60 skulls for a dog sure it does God for your guy or girl but still I had to do a level so many times I mean WTF but it's a great game get more games from glu	1
2727797	I have a subscription to the paper edition to People Magazine.  The ad indicated I could get a digital version. But they want another $35 in addition to the hefty subscription fee I already pay!  WTF??? This should be free to paid subscribers.  Forget this app!	1
2728138	I love this game but I wish there wasnt a paywall for a lot of buildings and characters. Barney alone costs almost $20, WTF? I understand charging money for some things to make a profit but all premium items are waaay too expensive.	4
2733981	This is a really cute app, but after about 5 minutes. WTF! WHY CAN'T IT JUST WORK!!!???? I hate it when I spend $$ on apps with bugs!	1
2734837	Its a great time waster &amp; cool graphics. But yet again, I hate that developers have to put in the in-app purchases. And this one doesn't even have levels to buy, just one level of $7 for earning double the coins! WTF? Who cares? That's the least of my concerns!	4
2735554	THAT IS STUPID. THEY DONT HAVE TIME WARNER CABLE IN THERE. I THINK I JUST WASTED MY TIME. IF IT HAS ANOTHER NAME wtf? SO WHAT HAPPENED IS TIME WARNER CABLE NOT A PROVIDER??? THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY! INSTANTLY DELETED IN A MATTER OF 15 SECONDS!	3
2744753	Hate. Irritating. Wtf? Boring. It's a pretty simple concept but it's just a time waster. I much prefer Angry Birds!	1
2754439	I'm not able to play &quot; The amazing Spider-Man&quot; on my tablet.<br />Paid $6.99 for it and it doesn't work . . . Wtf WOW b.s	1

2765815	I get to the door outside of the house. The 3 headed dog is down there. I complete a task and the game cuts off. WTF!!	1
2769702	It freaking sucks, it takes 3 minutes to upgrade your bot and then it's like it didn't even upgrade it. Plus waaaaaaaay to much ads I had to spam the X button. Plus wtf  this, THE FOURTH LEVEL IS LIKE A FREGGIN BOSS FIGHT. Wtf reliance games wtf?<br /><br />_Ryan Mann	1

2778667	Good graphics. Smooth play mostly. Would give it more stars but there are bad network issues. And they put all kinds of things in place to make it seem coop (guilds, friend invites, chat, but no co-op play...seriously wtf? Why bother with the other stuff if no co-op?)	3
2781560	MAKE IT WORK wtf me and my brother where exsided to get it but it would not work whatever just work	1
2785332	ok, so i read the reviews of this app and it all sounds kosher<br />according to the review at the topmost.<br />I install it and try out the 1st  one, the short session with wake up<br />and it does seem to help, but then....<br />A short time later I was doing something on the kindle in the<br />settings area and happened upon the security settings and what<br />I found shocked and awed me not to mention confused me<br />completely!<br />Try this: If your a kindle fire user pull down the notification area<br />at the top and go to More - Security - Device Administrator.<br /><br />Why on gods green earth is Total  Relaxation in the Device<br />Administration area?? WTF MAN...<br /><br />I mean i know what that's for, but I see know reason for the<br />Total Relaxation app or any one associated with it need to<br />take over your device, I mean the app isn't like rocket science<br />complicated.<br /><br />So can anyone explain why this app shows up in Device<br />Administration??<br />Until then I personally am kicking the app to the curb until a<br />good explanation is given.<br /><br />zm	1
2787426	It seems that it's hanging on the launch, using a Kindle Fire. It worked for a long time and up to this recent patch, was a fun game...not sure wtf they screwed up.	3
2790546	it seems great but it wont let me download it no matter how much apps I delete. Basically it took my freakin money WTF!? :(	1
2790581	Test drive works. Control on scrolling through the article is choppy but works. Download it though and you are stuck at a preview screen. Where all you can do is pick between android, Windows, iPhone and BlackBerry and see a damn phone. Wtf????	1
2791385	Just taking a break for a sec to state how funny the humor is in this game. Just met the bright team, wtf! Highly recommended!	5
2801249	We loved this app on the Fire HD and iPad, but now they limited viewing some shows to certain cable providers.  WTF?  Aren't they competing against cable?  If I had cable, I wouldn't need this app, I'd use my DVR, or watch better shows on cable.  Way to screw the pooch ABC.	1
2802148	King is a terrible anti-competitive company. You should uninstall this and check out other &#34;candy&#34; and &#34;saga&#34; games.<br /><br />I'm not sure who is worse... King for applying for these ridiculous trademarks or the US for approving them... WTF... Should I make a game and trademark &#34;story&#34; and start suing the heck out of Kairosoft now?	1
2802481	every freaking time a draw four wildcard comes up and I challenge it,it always fail like wtf seriously and the computers can challenge it completely fine and it is successful for them it is total bs don't get it waste of time and memory	1
2820138	I hung the Wells Fargo Mobile over my baby's crib, and all she did was cry.<br />I tried to make it more fun, but the website wouldn't let me change the colors OR the music and my baby just cried and cried.<br />WF should be called WTF cause they don't do something or gimmee something that I should get for free. I am a victim, hear me roar.<br />Darn you all to heck, WF!	1
2821002	I enjoy the game, it relaxes me before I go to sleep it is very fun. Who are you to require the amount of words wtf !	5
2827909	I was playing level 63 and got a sugar crush and then it told me that the level failed wtf? and this is not the first time this game cheated me, it did it on another level as well...	3
2831272	I just dl this app and their closet. went to create a new weemee and a popup window says the application unexpectedly closed. wtf. will not work on my kindle fire	1
2842625	The game is super fun. Addicting as angry birds 1. But. BUT. There is too much grinding if you don't buy the 6.99 coin doubled. If you do, your golden. Unless your a tool and pay the 50 bucks, yes real money, for the cart, cause guess what? It only works for the first level!!! So then you would have to buy several more to keep the advantage. Just don't. The game is great, spring the seven bucks, it's worth it. Annoying that the birds get tired, limiting your play, and you MUST BEAT your friends on Facebook to complete levels. Uh, guys, my friends don't play this game, so wtf?	5
2848586	The first time I played this it seemed really fun. However, after playing it more than once you realize that the questions are EXACTLY the same everytime... wtf?!	1
2853334	ok....this is a fun game but the only thing that you do is fight and complete FORCED missions. I kept dying for doing nothing but Salinger around..AND THE WARDENS ARREST YOU FOR EVERYTHING AND ADD MORE TIME TO YOUR SENTENCE! I WAS CLIMBING ON A LADDER AND ACCAEDENYLY LANDED ON A COFFIN THEN I LEFT THE ROOM.. THE NEXT THING I KNOW IS THAT IM BEING WANTED ON THE ENTERCOM FOR DOING THAT THEN I HAVE TO STAY IN PRISON FOR 20 MORE DAYS!! WTF GAME?! ALSO WHEN YOU KILL SOMEONE YOU ARE SENTENCED TO A VERY LONG EXTENDENCE OF TIME THEN WHEN SOMEONE ELSE KILLS YOU THE WARDENS DONT CARE!!? I MEAN THE PRISONERS BREAK THE RULES ALL THE TIME AND THE WARDENS DONT CARE! WHEN YOU BREAK A RULE ALL OF THE WARDENS IN THE ROOM ARE TRYING TO EITHER ARREST YOU (OR THEY KILL YOU AND DONT EVEN CARE! honestly. only get this game if you are ready for an unfair fight	3
2857911	Ok so I've been using this app for about 2 weeks now and the developers need to fix BUGS/GLITCHES in the app. I open the app it closes out. J restart my kindle and my internet box and it does the SAME thing. So it's not my internet connection because I've restarted plenty of times for that to be determined and it seems as if it's the app. Even when I'm trying to open tv shows it says &quot;error&quot; and gives me a code and tells me to try it later. Wtf I'm not satisfied at all with this app. Please fix. And consider all problems.	1

2872609	I watched it and then died it took foreva to load like a man haha but i nvr got the idea n mlp i dont understand why ppl so against bronies wtf ifunny	3
2890486	"This is one of those things that's a PRETTY GOOD idea, but falls short of the mark in so many LITTLE ways it just leaves you frustrated that it's SO CLOSE to be GREAT.<br /><br />For MANY, esp people who already have Dropbox installed on their computers, people who are using a command line all the time (huh?) this would be a fine purchase.<br /><br />I'm a programmer, and while I appreciate the CONCEPT and PRICE, there are just a FEW more things I'd like to see in this to reach a very good level of usefulness I'm going to have to keep looking.<br /><br />I'm inserting this as I've found some things which have made me go REALLY sour on this.<br /><br />1) Changing the priority of even one task MAKE THE THING HANG?  (I have to quit the app then return.  At least the changes worked, but WTF?) I have synch set to MANUAL - so connectivity isn't/shouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />I have like 20 tasks TOTAL and changing a single line in a simple text file makes it HANG?<br /><br />2) DELETING multiple tasks makes it HANG?<br /><br />3) Looking for HELP - it seems the only help is about using a command line interface.  REALLY?  The author seems to have the INSANE idea that people using SMART PHONES and TOUCH TABLETS want to somehow use a command line interface?  I run Linux, but hell if I want to open a shell to type out a long line of code (watch your typing!) to update a freakin' \\""to-do list\\"".<br /><br />Back to the original review:<br /><br />Every time I use it, I end up saying how I wish it did this or that:<br /><br />1) I'd love to be able to simply order things by dragging these things up and down.  You can \\""sort\\"" by any number of text-handling ways, but on my phone, I just want to drag items up and down.<br /><br />2) I'd love to be able to nest and collapse things, even just a single level.  This would enable handling projects which require multiple steps.  I want to use such a thing on my phone to help me organize things, rather than force me to think about how to organize things.<br /><br />3) The use of Dropbox for a single, simple text file is a total misfire.  I know they have 10 billion users and users get 200 terabytes for free (or is it really far fewer users have created multiple free accounts for themselves?), but what if this is the only reason you need a Dropbox account?. You can't even edit this file online.  Rather, in order to use it from your PC, you have to either install the client which then uses your PC's memory all the time while polling your network like every 30 seconds, or manually download, edit, then upload the file again.  Dropbox's recent security problems don't help either.<br /><br />Seriously, Dropbox should buy this app as a form of promoting their service, because that's pretty much what it does.  (or rename it to \\""Todo.txt for Dropbox\\"")<br /><br />For (most) people who aren't married to Dropbox, better would have been to have some kind of browser add-on or Wordpress add-on that would allow online editing.  Wow. That would be great.<br /><br />So here's the dream app:  1) Doesn't hang when doing basic things.  2) Lets me drag items up and down.  3) Lets me nest items just one level and collapse children 4) uses something I can access in my browser to let me directly edit said items without requiring me to install a constantly running daemon on my computer.organize things.<br /><br />3) The use of Dropbox for a single, simple text file is a total misfire.

2891765	I actually love this game but I couldn't log back in through Facebook after logging out. I know what you're thinking but yes, I did sync it to my Facebook account.  Every time I try to log in the screen gets black and goes back to the game without it being logged in.  I know for a fact that my account is still there because when I created a new account and tried to use my same name it said that it was already in use.  Dude wtf is going on and when is it going to get fixed?!	3
2893811	Are you kidding me? G is for gun!??? WTF?!!! That can't be an accident. The NRA has to get them young. Do not download this app.	1
2918435	The actual app is repetitive but fine for essentially being a promo for Lasik, but I have never encountered more annoying ads in my life. They quite literally interrupt gameplay with them. Total wtf.	1
2924823	What!!! I payed gameloft 999 coins on my kindle fire for a elite car pack and it just took the money without giving the cars????? WTF GAMELOFT I WANT MY MONEY BACK<br />Otherwise 5 stars but I just cant accept that so 3 stars	3
2934944	Review as of 2013-12-30<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />none<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />No live video<br />No list of shows<br />No listening or watching old episodes<br /><br />WTF did I buy?	1
2935031	!I stoped playing do to this its sad the kept camaro Pontiac ect Pontiac isn't even a brand so WTF! WHERES DODGEEEE	1
2935268	I don't under stand this game just shows this wtf it ..just shows this this app sucks...<br />so I would not get this app ....-.-	1
2936233	Save some time and download &#34;Ultimate Jewel&#34; instead.  I was looking for a match 3 game and downloaded Candy Crush because it seems like everyone is playing it.  I don't know why!  This game is terrible.  Sure it is a match 3 game, and it runs fine, but that's all I can say positive about it.<br />  I played it for about 2-3 weeks and finally couldn't take it any more.  I can't stand the limited number of moves before it says you lose and exits the round, even though matches were still available.  You can try again but after a certain number of tries it says your out of tries.  However they're more than happy to sell you more tries for real money.  WTF!!!!  I though they were making a game to be fun, but as it turns out they are just trying to get rich off people.<br /><br />IGNORE THE HYPE AND SKIP THIS GAME.  Ultimate Jewel is a whole lot better, it's a free download and doesn't try to sell you on anything once you've got it.  I don't know how Candy Crush has become so popular, but I've deleted it from my device, and my cloud.	1
2940525	Paid to remove ads and the notifications quit working on my nexus 5. I redownloaded the free version and the notifications work just fine. WTF? They also asked for to many unnecessary permissions.	1
2953767	It Won't even download fully it's a bunch of cheap I'm pretty sure it would be a good game but I wouldn't know fix it!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm gonna try one more time and if it ain't working then I'm done it's suck at 100% downloaded and won't install.....WTF(the F's in Wtf mean fudge) come on now let's keep it of now oh never mind it's installed sorry but it does freeze up while downloading	3
2954445	Good looking app, with plenty of things to play with, but sadly, most of the videos say they're not available due to being expired or copyright issues.  WTF??  Hard to explain to a 5 year old that those videos are there, but you can't view them.<br />Disappointing.	2
2956710	the latest update to the update may have fixed proleague but I was hoping they'd fix the decals...they didn't...now every car has a white stripe including the cars you already own...wtf? and some don't even line up!!! the firebird for example has the white stripe through the passenger window...imagine a custom red camaro competition with its black racing stripes on the hood but a stupid out of place white stripe on the side!!!! over 90% of the cars look stupid now as the stripe is either not aligned or just plain horrible...I used to love playing the game but the visuals are all screwed up!!!!	3
2959976	This game is very fun to play, and also has more advanced graphics and video options than I expected. Extremely satisfied with performance, and frame rate. Didn't have a problem with frame loss with this game like I did with gta III on the iPod touch 4g a few years back. Now all rockstar has to do is port GTA III to the kindle fire app store and I will be set for life :P. *Update* sometimes app crashes and you have  to delete it and redownload it and then start from the beginning. Only encountered this problem once, however. Overall great game for a price with minor flaws. The size of Vice city is surprisingly large for the game; I was expecting it to be a lot smaller than it feels in-game. If you purchase this game I would highly suggest you get the hidden packages first because you won't have to spend a lot on armor or weapons. Also I believe the way to counteract the app the app crashing problem is on kindle instead of hitting the guide tool bar button and exiting to the home from there, I think if you exit the game from the app it should help prevent this problem from happening. Also I hope they add awards to this game some time in the future for the Amazon store because I wouldn't hesitate to go for a 100% completion on here. Play this app whenever I'm in the mood to or when I'm bored and it helps calm some nerves really. At least for me it does. This application also has a few bugs. I happened to experience a strange wtf glitch on here on my second play-through. Best app on the Amazon Appstore available at the moment. Hopefully they add san andreas and gta 3 soon. *once again another app review update* DEAR ROCKSTAR GAMES PLEAS FIX THIS APP'S CRASHING PROBLEMS AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR FIVE STAR RATING FROM NO BACK. Had to redowload the stupid thing again because every time I go to start the game it crashes before it even gets to the title screen of the game. For those who have the same problem, I would advise you guys to file a complaint to the company to fix this problem, as that's what I'm doing and it would help if I could get some support on this. File the report onto the official rockstar site, not on Amazon.is problem, as that's what I'm doing and it would help if I could get some support on this. File the report onto the official rockstar site, not on Amazon.	3
2963256	Personally, whenever I try to search a video it always says &quot;Error Parsing server&quot; and I'm thinking in my head WTF I have 100 megabit wireless internet!!!!!!! Is this happening to anyone else.	2

2999989	I've played for 34days. Had 700some xp to go til lvl 14. Had the nog bar,Flanders,Simpson's home decor. A Marge snow lady. The holiday tree, over 2k in those damn gift cards 15k in cash..so I decided to buy 132donuts. App won't load past the login if u have an origin account. Tap to continue. Then it crashes.

3008377	This game is way better than clash of clans however I do not mean this because<br />of how you made the ship's. I have to pay 200 oil just to use a dang attack...WTF<br />C clash of clans is just a better game over all	5

3019496	I have this app on my phone and I love it but on my kindle it won't let me log in WTF!?!?	1
3020820	This game Is so fun. It is a lot better than gangstar Rio because<br />1.) There are more ways to make money.<br />2.) There are easier controls for vehicles (especially for planes &amp; helicopters.<br />3.) There is a bigger variety of weapons clothes &amp; vehicles.<br />4.) The main missions pay a lot more money<br /><br />The storyline isn't as exciting as gangstar Rio because in Rio there were so many twists and unexpected events going on. On gangstar Rio I felt poor all the time because I never made money after I beat the game except for the little minigames that still give small money like robbing the bank which only gave you 3500 dollars like wtf . Gangstar vegas makes me feel like I'm playing gta and this is a good game to play while I wait to get gta v on Christmas ( hopefully )	5
3026251	random title as usual anyways i was playing slenderman the arrival i beet it i play this and then i think i should review it and i nearly s*** myself because i turn around go to a room and everything is just...wow somehow i found NYAN CAT & JEFF THE KILLER IN THE SAME ROOM WTF????!!!! so im saying that if u think it u create it LITERALY NO JOKE  pease out ~~~~~~~> =3	5

3036995	I have a Kindle fire HD. the game works fine but now that im done with it. I cant delete it.WTF!!!!!!<br />now its eating up space for nothing.	1
3037095	Sure it costs $40 to get a controller for it, but the game itself is pretty cool. The only problem is that there is NO ONE THERE! There are 2 battlefields overall and every time I join one no one is there. Trust me, if you got a controller you'll enjoy it, but no one is there. WTF?	3
3037529	have some very recognizable sounds and short song clips. many were funny. please use caution as some are NOT for children as there is a curse word. (WTF)	4
3048046	Fun game, until you decide to spend money on one of their sales of quicksilver... and then you sit there wondering WTF.  It really pisses me off, since I had purchased a small amount previously which worked just fine.  Seems like a bait and switch, offer a sale to get a big order, but then not give the content purchased.  The most important aspect of a free game, where they make money off in app purchases... should be the in app purchasing however that is not the case.  Buyer's beware.	1
3050946	It used to work untell i accident ly deleted it then it wouldent work?<br />So wtf fix it plz i would realy enjoy it if u did	1
3051519	Rage mode glitches out lasting for like a millisecond before being gone? Wtf? Please fix. Otherwise it's a very solid game	3

3055379	I have this app on my iPhone and used it constantly, which is why I got it for my Kindle Fire. This review is for the app I use on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I love the selection of articles in Zite, and that I can select multiple areas of interest (or Favorites). What I don't like is:<br /><br />-- The app will suddenly shut down/close out without warning and without any reason.<br />-- With the iPhone app, I can email articles and the email provides a direct link to the article. (Great if I want to come back and print something), but with this app on my Kindle Fire, it emails the link to Zite, which can't be opened on a computer. WTF?<br /><br />Because of these two things, Zite on my Kindle Fire is used as a back up only. I still use my iPhone as my primary access to Zite.	3
3058114	it says I have to wait over 40 days until I get 1life. wtf is up with that? fix it. its really annoying how I cant play.	1
3058670	I'm sure it would be good but it wont let me install. WTF?! everytime I try to download it it does that	3
3061199	awesome!!! Gotta love Dave!!! Bedo Bedo Bedo Bedo.  Can we have an Agnes level maybe ...<br /><br />.............omg wtf can I just submit this thank you	5
3064656	Um, wtf? This is a tetras game, and a poor one at that. How is this stuff even allowed on the app store	1
3066797	I want to give this game a better review, but I can't.  It works initially and is really fun, but upon loading a saved game, the IAB code crashes on my Nexus tablets (I can see this in logcat).  Also, it's too small to play on my Nexus 7.  In addition the UI constantly messes up the touch events.  There seems to be a zoom mode which would probably make it playable, but I can't figure out how to activate it.<br /><br />It is playable on my Nexus 10, but I can't load a saved game due to the IAB crash.<br /><br />Update:  Crashes on load of saved game on my Fire HD 8.9 too.  WTF (What a Terrible Failure)	2
3076764	These jerks did an automatic download and used up my 3 Gigs plan on the first day of my billing cycle-WTF yosuck yahoo	1
3080168	This is a really fun game with just enough brain teasers to keep a person interested. I have played several games of this type in the past, and this one rates up there with my favorites.<br />Now, the downside. In the game you do go back and forth a lot. A LOT.<br />I also had some glitch's that seem to come at a poor time. I would have to restart the game but I only lost my very last move so it wasn't the end of the world. And sometimes the game locks up and that made me say WTF a few times. But all in all I have spent several fun hours playing this game. I did pop for the full version by the way. It was money well spent.	4
3080382	The controls can be so much better. Can't even move my fighter. Got to guess when to throw a punch. One weave button can't even throw a proper double jab. No Ireland flag wtf! Disappointed with all the hype behind this game. Land like 10 punches a round. Its a joke to compare this game to fight night rd 3. Step ur game up vivid! Quit bakin cakes and come up with better controls!	2
3082208	this used to work really great for skype. it started as a good messaging app and now it's like, trying to become it's own social network?! wtf, Imo?	1
3082274	It's good except when I put to Africans the baby still came mixed. The only differences between each baby is the hair color. WTF? Anyway it's good	5

WTF ! Has anyone else had this issue help!	2

3104832	The free version has an exit button, but this one does not? WTF? This needs an update with the same ability to exit quickly whenever I want.	1
3113792	This is great! I tried it on my friends and they were like wtf. It's really funny just don't take it too serious. Hilarious app	5
3115391	My husband and I both really like Marc Maron's format for WTF -  interesting guests, some tidbits from his life, good observational humor that's a touch dark sometimes. It's great. The Ben Sidran interview is one of the best ones on here - check it out.	5
3117702	See during certain times when I play this game I have lots of money from doing missions and stuff then when I need a little more money to get  a rocket launcher or tank I start a mission right,but noooo the game show a blank static screen like when you see Slender Man,then I exit the app and re-enter the app everything is the same as before BUT when I see my money balance I have $0!!!!!!(WTF where's my money this game need an update because this is the 4th time in 2 days!!!)but other than that this is a very fun and very great app :) Just plz help me Gameloft I want my money in game for tank or launcher.	4
3118645	this sad game has only 30 levels, most make no sence at all, i had to cheat on like 8 levels, because they dont make sence..... game has massive permissions, and is junk, in my opinion...... the other games in the series are free, so why the 99 price tag for this one..............<br /><br />the music in the game is horrid, ever see the movie &quot; The Emerald Forest&quot; every time i played the game i pictured naked amazonians dancing...... and even if you turn it off it turns its self back on......<br /><br />graphics are subpar and dated looking, has a windows 95 look and feel......  and lastly level 28.... WTF.... that puzzle is retarded and thank god for youtube.... cause after 12 attempts i was going to unistall before i completed it.....<br /><br />so the good bad and the ugly .......  &quot;This game is NOT good,  plays and sounds BAD,  and is UGLY<br /><br />And one last thing that is noteworthy, amazon reports it to be around 30 megs, huge for this game I thought, but when I checked it in my apps it wieghed in at over 50 megs..... very deceptive I thought......... Removing after I write this..................... Buh bye	1
3126861	it sucks I have it on my phone but I get that taken away like every week so I can text my gf so I thought why not get it on my kindle and text her but so I looked it up but there was no kik but there was kik shake I was like wtf is that I got it anyway and I cant do anything so don't get this app it sucks	1
3129039	I mean wtf? Kik was on my kindle and then a couple of weeks later kik is all of a sudden its not working? So i deleted it and its not there?i would really like kik messenger back if you would please?	1
3141284	This is Bull S*** I thought it was the actuall snapchat, but it's not. Even when you play the game you can't use much of the line so it's even worst. Just get the real snapchat like wtf!	1
3144594	I loved this app from day one, so much so that finally, literally a day ago I went and upgraded from the free version to the paid version. What was once my go to alarm clock app disappeared and I was left with something ugly in its place. Overnight the clock killed half of my kindle battery. EVERYTHING began running horribly slow on my fire. My keyboard would sometimes not work. The screen flip was slow and chuggy. WTF apalon! I figured it had something to do with the included weather options on the paid one... turned those off, it still ate battery life like a demon. Turned almost every extra option off and it still sucks. Tired to download the free version again and now it was updated to a lite version of the paid app.... that still causes all sorts of problems for my fire.<br /><br />So as of October 31st this app gets nothing but a 2 star from me. Time to look into another app I guess... which is sad because I used to love this clocks musical wake up.<br /><br />Edited Again 10-31:<br /><br />Downgrading to 1. Gave it one last try, redownloaded it and tried setting an alarm for an hour later. Just holding out hope that maybe it wasnt the app killing my battery--- at 11:15 tonight the alarm went off. Checked it to see how much battery life I had left. Went from 100% to 83% and I also noticed the clock at the top of main Kindle Fire screen (to the right of My Kindle) had frozen at 10:20. The app's time was correct, but my actual Kindle was an hour behind. At that point I uninstalled the app and had to restart my kindle for the time to register correctly on my device.	1
3145878	it was a great game till I downloaded the update. now I can't even open the game. what gives?  do I need to reinstall the whole thing again?  wtf??	1
3146996	I ordered a 499 thing of honor points and I got charged for a ten dollar and another 499 one wtf this is bs. Anyone know who or how I can get ahold of someone about what happens? Plz and thanks	2
3147354	Really good word game with some wtf? words. I like that it is challenging but some of the words seem a little made up. When you touch the word to get the meaning, it takes you to wiktionary where you find the word hasn't been used since the time of Shakespeare. Also some words are of another language and rarely used in English in any country. Yet words that appear regularly in other word puzzles do not work here. Maybe if the developers had used dictionary.com instead? Still a great game though. I have it on my phone and tablet and it works great, loads quickly and saves your game so you can pick up where you left of. Me	4
3149028	I bought this..and downloaded it..once I open it,it says I'm not the owner of who bought this and makes me quit out.WTF?! I want my money back then!	1

3162553	stupid tablet mightwell be thrown into a fire. KINdlE fIrE<br />Wont even charge plus wtf does Frost wire stand for	1
3169648	I am not sure what you are trying to do here? Is this your hello world in App form? No features what so ever and the graphics look low res and blocky. Please don't actually ever take anyones money for this application. Two stars for no permissions on an app that does nothing. Also note has saved correctly? Wtf kinda verbage is that?	2
3174144	This app does not work on my kindle. WTF kind of app are y'all trying to push on customers? I'm glad it was free.	1
3174390	This is a cute app but When I heard the Wtf BUTTON i WAS A LITTLE UNHAPPY... HAD A DISCUSSION WITH MY DAUGHTER about playing this app what is okay and what is not	3
3180215	I love this game but during the game it will sometimes have 3 or more bonus round symbols but won't give you a bonus but mainly I just updated and I had over 1. 3 MILLION!!!! And now I only have 100,000!!!! Wtf!! I want my coins back!!!	2
3185378	he stripper wont dance when I pay her... like WTF! serisouly man? over all its a well made game and worth the money	1

3195797	Wtf ive been trying to login to kik for two days and it stopped working wtf bring it back asap!! Why did they get rid of it anyway	1
3197192	I navigate to where I need, says it needs internet connection, which it has and is using.  I need to then re-navigate to where I was.  Unacceptable.  Oh, and it's playing right now too.  WTF!	1
3198550	ive played this game on my phone and I want it on my kindle and I literally removed everything so I can play it... and it says still to much memory WTF!!!!	1
3200210	I hate this game! It randomly throws me out with spins left! It subtracts points from my score even though I get letters right and/or even win the game! It should be WTF not WTP!	1
3204336	i have used this for 2 years. now I need to upgrade but don't have access to Play store. Is it a developer issue or Amazon?  WTF?  Outcome: Uninstalled and saved 27meg.	3
3206197	but it's certainly lacking and keeps you mildly entertained. I gave it 3 stars because of how well designed the game was and nice graphics. What makes it boring though is how you don't get to interact to much with the guys (like seriously 4 lines where you can choose your interaction) and the rest of the game is you &#34;working&#34; by tapping that you work but not doing anything at all. What made me like their flower game so much in Fairbrooke is that there was a game you played every time you worked so it did not feel boring.<br /><br />I was bored here, it was repetitious, and the whole point of  the game of deciding outcomes for which guy to date never really had a chance to occur. It would just show a bubble saying that you talked to so and so when no such conversation actually took place.<br /><br />More interaction please!! And allow the players to do something while they &#34;work&#34;  like in the other game so this does not play so monotonously doing practically nothing since you never interact with other guys for conversations and the whole game passes like freebo.<br /><br />The game is over and it's like, &#34;ahh....&#34; it never really improved, wtf?!<br /><br />So yeah, bored gamer.<br /><br />Love the graphics though and design. Good story line too.	3
3208380	"Tried to purchase the latest episode of \\""Walking Dead\\"" this morning.  It finally downloaded, but the app now insists that I have to have a Comixology account.  So I created an account, but now I keep getting error messages saying that I have to sign in (even after I HAVE signed in) to view my purchases, and my Kindle Fire HD apparently isn't authorized to view purchases (even though I've been reading comics on it for the past 6 months).<br /><br />WTF Comixology?????  Get this fixed, and NOW, or I expect a full refund that every purchase I've made in the last year and 1/2, and then I'll uninstall the app."	1
3228114	I was loving this app until I got to the WTF button. I'm not sure why this was necessary in an app where the majority of the sounds are clips from kids movies. I was shocked and sadden as we do not use language like this in our home and sitting with all of my children they heard this word. Although thanks for the opportunity to teach my children what we do NOT say!	1
3231711	Well ! I have emailed you people and have yet to receive a response. I emailed about 5 days ago. WTF ! Nobodys that busy...And it won't even work on my kindle anymore if I could give this app a NEGATIVE ZERO I would but I cant..----______-----	1
3232026	its a copy of bloon tower defence and its weard and annoying you have to defend your tower from eggs like WTF?! and when you kill them they drop sunnyside up eggs its weard this game is for fat people	1
3234861	Amazon should not allow apps that do not work on your phone. WTF. I hope I can remove . I will report to amazon.<br />Update - I reported this app to Amazon, could not get on amazon with the phone it was installed on, this whole thing has taken me over one hour and still do not have everything working. It's interesting to me that they claim they are number one and only have eight reviews and the newest one is from 2011? I hope after Amazon's review they are removed from their apps.	1
3237913	I'm having issues typing this comment even! Wtf! First it works for like an hour, then it crashes, over,and over,and over. Big deal. By  the bad thing is that it crashes YOUR WHOLE DEVICE AND ALL ITS APPS!! All I get now is ____is not responding, would you like to close the program? I can't even open my pictures! BOTTOM LINE DO NOT GET!!!!!!	1
3238579	Used to be my favorite bunt slowly hating. Have to log on EVERY time I want to read an issue I don't have downloaded really you can't remember this?  Where is October's issue? One issue I have has display problems that cannot be fixed WTF!?	3
3238683	"I got this app today and have had fun listening to it randomly go off both at school and at home and sometimes it just makes me giggle.<br /><br />Anyways so my mom got home late from work and I showed her the app and was telling her all the words it said through out the day and and said I found it funny and as she said, \\""If I wasn't so tired\\"" legit AS SHE SAID TIRED the app went off and said tired and I laughed my fool butt off but she gave this dude wtf look rofl<br /><br />Anywho, fun app if you're easily amused or have friends hanging around to joke with you about it."	5
3240840	whyy even bother calling it ONE HUNDRED DOORS. if there are not ONE HUNDRED DOORS? ! I must admit the game is good but wtf let me play to ONE HUNDRED !!! this is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!	3

3249702	I downloaded this app cause I wanna play Sims. plus its free. but as soon as I opened the app it said that it needed an additional 300 or so megabytes to download plus around 800 megabytes of free app space. wtf DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!!! ITS A TRAP!!!! LEAVE NOW!!! BOOK IT MAN WGAT ARE WAITING FOR!!!?!!!!! but seriously just don't get this app. uninstalled forever.	1
3252774	If the app even responds when I try to go on every turn I take it freezes and I have to close it. I even uninstalled it and reinstalled hoping it would work seamlessly....but nope. And I like this game that's why it's so Damn frustrating when I just want to do is play and boom it either won't start or does and I take one turn, then have to wait to restart the app again because its unresponsive to take my next turn. AND IT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE TIME AND EVERY SINGLE TURN WTF!!!!!!	2
3263058	I was a level 37..had over 41 tickets...had over $200;000..played everyday for last 28 days..went to log on to play and it wasn't MY park...it was a level 22..0 tickets and $2000.00...wtf..I read some comments on facebook and their are people that will hack your park and take everything..this game sux	1

3282823	When I first received my kindle fire I was excited. Needless to say the ability to watch porn on a bigger screen then my Samsung galaxy was exhilarating. I immediately began cruising my usual porn sites and started sexting as is tradition, But soon the gravity of the situation would reveal its self. As I began taking my selfies I would soon realized there was no timer setting!?!?!?! (  WTF hasn't this been like a standard feature since like digital cameras came out???) ?!!?!?! Crushed and Dismayed I took to the app store and found an app capable of handling those responsibilities..... that's when I found your app. Now I can stand proud and naked without my huge arms in the way of my baby leg!!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU &quot;MAKING ART STUDIO&quot; FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE AGAIN!!!<br /><br />P.S. You have made allot of women happy, and that`s something we can all be proud of.	5
3284487	Don't buy.it downloaded an additional 3 more apps...wtf... I couldn't get the damn thing to play, just a load of spam	1
3284570	I have played for 13 spins and now you want me to rate this! WTF<br />I think this is way too early to rate anything<br />what else?<br /><br />good by	3
3303273	I have not seen a game more worthless then this. Wish I could give it less then one star. All you do is kill alpacas WTF?	1
3313440	I was using this app fine until I was told I needed a mandatory update to continue use. The problem is that the update is not available in the Amazon market. WTF!!!!! I don't understand why the  is happening. The app should be deleted from th  market or the update should be available. The app is now obsolete in my Kindle Fire HD.	1
3333756	I'm not getting any pics/memes, but I AM getting seriously po'd! All I have are the categories but they're blank. I get a message saying if I'm having trouble downloading pics, there may be a problem with tmblr and please keep trying. WTF?!?! It's been over 2 hours and it's still trying to download on my KF. Grrrrrr!! I will gladly change this review when/IF I get a chance to use it	1
3337202	Controls for the board are unseen and it's pure guesswork to figure out how to use it.  The clocks are especially mysterious with functions that I can't imagine would be useful.  One counts up while the other counts down?  WTF?  I finally got it to work acceptably, but the method for movement of pieces is really lame.	3
3338146	NO. DONT DO IT. YES U KNOW WHAT I MEAN. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. IDK WTF I JUST PLAYED BUT IT WAS THE QUICKEST THING I EVER DELETED. WASTE OF TIME AND IM SCARRED FOR LIFE. DEMENTED AS HELL	1
3340031	"This app has so much potential (the iPhone/iPad version is pretty decent in comparison).<br />These comments are as of 8/28/2013 and subject to change.<br /><br />The Good: Good picture and Audio quality on the Kindle Fire(HD) with decent response-to-click ratio.  When it doesn't freeze up that is. This is probably the only redeeming value of this app at this time as just about everything else is problematic or overall \\""WTF were they thinking?\\"" type of response. I gave 2 stars for the Picture/Audio quality when it works.<br /><br />The Bad: In no particular order.  No ability to log in.  You can't view your favorites, check on friends streams or even view them unless they are on the Featured/Browse Channels by chance or popularity. No Search feature so you can't go to someone's stream or view their profile.  Why either of these rather basic features are not added to this app is beyond me.  All in all, there are problems with this low grade poor quality App."	2
3347009	I was excited to see this game on Android. But was horrified to find that it seems to be for the Kindle Fire ONLY.<br />WTF?! So many Android devices out there and the developer decides to shaft 90+% of them! I was looking forward to playing this on my Nexus 7 since playing on my iPhone is hard sometimes.<br /><br />Fix this please!	1
3348633	I was never able to see any video. WTF, how does that happen?! Sound comes through just fine but movies appear blank.	1
3354307	This game was great. I enjoyed playing it. Even decided to actually spend a couple bucks and buy gems... not 24 hours after that my game updated... now it wont play. Stops at 50% download and tells me &quot;string not found&quot;. WTF!? I tried reinstalling,  no luck.<br />This is the 3rd Gameloft game that screwed up on my Kindle. Wont bother trying any more of their products...Most certainly wouldn't dare spending money on them either.	1
3360354	was fantastic app before. loved it. just got around to installing the update and holy mother of crap WTF???!!? layout and features totally changed. bring back the previous version pleeeeeeeeaaaaaase.	1
3364431	TIME's link to their available issues was a dead link: no hot spot to go forward. My Kindle's screen-sized TIME cover takes me to an online page hawking the magazine and the two issue I actually have are there, but WTF?!? Love TIME, think their customer sevice and response and follow-up questionairre are automatic, soulless and obviously, nobody's home.	3
3368067	Every time I open it comes up with a window box that says you do not own this app.. with two options, either close or see more details. I click see more details &amp; it brings me exactly here! Wtf...	1
3379874	I've paid $19.99 for a 235 Credit Pack for Bingo Blitz.  For some reason, I haven't received my credits.  This is the second time this that something like this has happened to me.  WTF Amazon?!?!	1

3394827	Luv the game but 7.2 still needs to come wtf anyway I would still buy it because it is fun  still need	4
3400587	Talk about greedy. Hulu Plus charges 8 bucks a month to watch past TV shows and some movies and documentaries that are filled with advertisements through the whole episodes. It's like watching it on TV but you are paying 8 bucks for it! WTF? I'll keep giving Nexflix my 8 dollars a month and NOT be forced to watch the same commercial over and over and over throughout what I'm viewing! (NO, you can't fast forward through the commercials either ...... You HAVE to watch them!) No Thanks Hulu!	1
3407484	Playability, 5 stars. Unfortunately I can't unlock anything in the store! Nothing will unlock, it says I'm not connected. Yeah right, but I can get on the internet to get to the Amazon store, and I'm not connected? Wtf, please fix that. I'll rate at 4 or 5 stars when it's fixed. I know connectivity isn't my issue.	1
3409546	The game wouldn't even allow me to play and it banned me from playing this on my tablet...wtf guys??!?! It looks awesome but wouldn't work.	1
3410712	You got to buy this app? Wtf! It's a shame. I can get it free for my phone but not my kindle. You suck!	1
3410772	"I downloaded this app thinking how cool it would be to get historical documentaries on my tablet. But... \\""Pawn Stars. American Pickers. Vikings. Now you can watch your favorite HISTORY shows wherever and whenever you want...\\""<br /><br />Ugh... WTF is wrong with you history channel?!? Where did we go wrong??"	1
3411199	So I got this app so since i have the full game on my PC and its way better than Candy Crush but the graphics are all messed up...everything is scooted up and to the left so you can't see clearly wtf is going on. I'm pretty bummed I'm out $.99.	1
3416290	I recently purchased this app and it said app not yet owned  WTF  screw this app I wasted 1 dollar	1
3429004	scratch off don't do anything to my to my score or multiplier. WTF fix this.  This is good game to pass the time.	5
3430684	"it has a seriously problem: something wrong with IN-APP payment! WTF it can't pay for IAP that it said \\""not ready\\"" when I use to tried bought more levels.  FIX IT!!!"	2
3432904	After many months of my 5yr old begging for this, we see the developer has FINALLY created an Android port.  WTF took so long?  Will we get Stack the Countries, too?  Only time will tell if the developer cares or not.<br /><br />-1 star for making my child wait.	4
3435352	Good for the news. There is a problem though somehow it got undownloaded by itself. When I went to download it again it says it 1183 % downloaded. So I am like WTF! Anyone else have this problem?	2
3437443	Popcap NEVER should have offered this countdown app, since they seem to have no idea when the game is actually coming out. The counter has been reset many times, and when the app finally counted down to &quot;It's out!,&quot; the game was nowhere to be found in the store. Now, the countdown is showing another 28 days until the release? Wtf??! Way to turn my excitement into anger, Popcap. Un installing this worthless app today.	1
3449328	I am sick of not being able to download apps to my Kindle Fire because they are not compatible with this device. What is the point of having them on here if they don't work? I even have emailed about this and was told to call and get help that way. WTF? Why can't they just email me back and help me out that way? I can't wait to buy an Ipad and will be able to acually purchase apps and have them actually work and not have to deal with compatibility issues. I am through with Kindles,ugh!!!!	1
3450005	"The \\""new\\"" Sirius/XM app for iPad is a great idea...if only they included it with the master subscription you pay for your car. But, as many others have pointed out, they think they can pull the wool over customer's eyes by calling it a \\""free\\"" app, then charging the customer for an additional device -- whether it be a home unit, car, phone, or whatever. Hey, Sirius/XM! Free marketing advice: Bundle all a customer's devices into one simple subscription -- and no matter what their initial status is/was. Sirius/XM should be all about a single home/personal subscription that applies to all that subscriber's devices. Period! My wife and I both drive Ford products, both have been subscribers for years....and with a double subscription, I still can't get a Sirius/XM signal in my home without an additional charge. Much less an iPad. WTF? Keep this up and you'll be just like the airline industry, nickel and diming everybody to death with added baggage charges, etc. Oh. I almost forgot....how's that Sirius/XM NASDAQ stock doing? Uh....tanking? Maybe the current marketing team should be removed and somebody with some savvy marketing sense brought in. Ridiculous chain of events. They keep \\""circling the drain\\"" and putting it to the consumer. Former CEO Mel Karmazin ran CBS Radio and Viacom into the ground...then had the unmitigated gall to say he was the most underpaid CEO when he accepted the job at Sirius. Really, Mel. The reason you're so underpaid...is that YOU SUCK. And so do all your cronies who have been awarded \\""golden parachute\\"" deals of $millions as they've run Sirius/XM into near oblivion. Hopefully, the new CEO, Jim Meyer, will have some vision...and do the right thing for all existing and new Sirius/XM subscribers. Let's all hope so, Sirius/XM Nation."	1
3463604	This stuff is definitly not my favorite first many times you attempt to pass someone that swerves into your lane if your going fast you sometimes end up hitting the wall trying to swerve to another lane and last right around 9,000 you get the cops try your best outrunning them even when you speed off they get closer to you WTF im not superman i cant outrun cops that will pull you over anyways sorry about my complaining	1

3473057	I fell in love with this game when I found it. Well yesterday I had about 30,000 coins and was at level 133 on the arcade machine and suddenly my tablet spazzed out and reset itself and when it booted back up I was back at level 1, my upgrades were gone, and I was broke. Wtf whyyyy??? =(	3
3475373	This game is a waste of time. Before I got it I thought it was a dragon's minecraft, it turned out to be a game where u have to dodge random monsters. Wtf? It didn't even let u dodge the monsters. DON'T GET THIS APP ITS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!	1
3476035	First of all I HATE this game!!! It works horrible on my Kindle Fire. The little keys that you get to move are SO FLIPPING GLITCHLY!!!! And the space bar is actually this: #.<br />At the bottom right corner, I with we could just use our fingers on each side. Right? Like wtf man!!! So I do NOT approve of this app, at all the graphics need a BIT.	1
3477058	Ok i bought it, expected it to be on my phone and it is and was nowhere to be found. WTF.	1
3479459	You can't even take a pic on here!!WTF and u have to pay I got this free on my iPhone !! Ahhh so mad !!!if I could rate this for zero I would!!!! So mad!!!! I WISH THE APP WAS THE SAME AS IT IS ON A IPHONE !!!DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PEOPLE, DON'T BUY THIS	1
3480488	this game os good if you like playing alone but when rf is 0.7.2 coming out amazon like really its freaking safe you let the other updates come but not realms wtf!!!!!!!!!!	4
3480821	I gave it 4 stars because the game cannot be moved to an external card.  Took about 80mb.  WTF.  No reason for a game this size should reside on the internal memory.<br /><br />The game itself is really fun to play.  Has lots of levels and missions to keep you going.	4
3484480	easy is hard, and hard is easy...mixed up math app...turned my daughter off....93x1245= huh? especially sideways...wtf? thought it would be more fun, game oriented...we'll stick with the web.	1
3485338	Uh it kept crashing while getting the mountain but got past that and then on level 14 it doesnt have anymore quests its like wtf waste of time if u want a game that blows this is the one	1
3492481	this game is challenging and fun! I am slowley becoming addicted!!! some are easy, yet some are hard. but I believe &quot;wtf is that word&quot; is a must have for all ages!!!	4
3492705	Not worth the money!!!!!!!! It shows the same boring ones over and over again! And also in between each prank is a stupid picture of some girl....... I know wtf? Well very frustrating. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!! &gt;:(	1
3497033	Why on earth does this app have to d/l  3 different times?the last d/l took over 10 minutes long and loaded for just about 4 minutes. Completely despicable!<br /><br />In app purchases are despicable also..there's no way to tell if your buying something by accident what so ever. Despicable<br /><br />WTF? Anyone who would Hand this game over to a child would be crazy.<br />completely despicable!	1
3507590	I read. A lot. I have hundreds of ebooks on my kindle fire. And this app gives them filenames like Amazon does when it sends books to you over its system. Which sucks considering I use calibre and all my books have proper titles, author names, meta data and covers in my computer database. Having hundreds of books show up in this program as B00001k83954.mbp or whatever is not in any way helpful.<br /><br />If the company could do something about making sure books and documents show up with the titles and information that they were assigned before I loaded them on my kindle I'd maybe change my mind.<br /><br />Otherwise my advice is don't bother. As far as I can tell there just isn't a decent, usable file system for the kindle fire at all. WTF developers?	1
3508633	Wow, decided to fire this game up on my Nexus7 after a not playing it in over a year because my son has started playing it on my wife's iPad. What a joke it is compared to the iPad version. If you can even get it to play without freezing on the loading screen it will freeze shortly after you start playing.<br /><br />This app has not been updated in 2 years. No tablet support for android, the graphics are really, really bad. But wait there is a special tablet version fire the Kindle Fire. WTF Pop Cap!<br /><br />This does not leave me much hope for Plants vs. Zombies 2 or Pop Cap fire that matter.	1
3512110	game hangs a lot,  tutorial are poor, the controls are poor, auto target poor. try playing for 10+ hour over three plus days is how I made sure these thing are not me. oh you can buy all the medal you want for real money 79.99 (80) dollar wtf. The game was free but not worrth any REAL MONEY.	2
3517645	Well in my opinion im not into games like this but when i watch the show i decided wtf i should try this game its funnnnn	4
3520535	I sent you guys an email to tell you that my in-game purchase to upgrade my virus has disappeared. So you got my $9.99 and the game doesn't show my purchase.  Wtf can I get a response? Or a refund? Or my virus upgrade? ? ANYTHING?  I used to love the game, so I wanted to do better, so I upgraded. A little courtesy and a<br />reply is owed to me please.	1
3523581	It's a good thing this was a free app. I downloaded this for my son and he couldn't play it. We keep getting a message about not owning the content. Wtf?  FIX IT.	1
3525543	THIS GAME IS S.T.U.P.I.D. BECAUSE IT WILL ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR EMAIL. SO I SETUP MY EMIAL ACCOUNT AND NOW IT WANTS ME TO SEND AN EMAIL OUT TO SOME ONE SAYING &quot; Let's play we shave&quot; WTF IS THAT	1
3525658	I advise you not to download this it sucks its just a scam I hate things that copy other apps its a total copy of minecraft wtf its stupid	1
3526237	Just got a galaxy -phone forces an amazon login. That is bad form. The app is  preloaded yet forces a log in. Can u explain that to me?  Need help linking my browsing to my profile?  Really?  Wtf?	1
3538091	It sucks it keeps saying &quot;not correct date or time, change then restart app if problem persists clear app&quot; and I'm like wtf all I want to do is watch Mulan II I never seen it before jeesh!!	1
3541327	This version of kik is seriously outdated, the version I currently have is 8.4 (i just download the apk from the internet)! And it keeps asking me to DOWNGRADE! Wtf Amazon!?	1
3552257	How can a card game take so much space in the device! Do they store high resolution pictures for every Magic:TG card ever released or what?!<br /><br />- First, you download a whooping 1.2 GB package from Amazon.<br />- Then, you install the package, which requires another gigabyte and a half of free space just to unpack<br />- Then, you run the game, and it says it needs to download an additional 1.2 GB! WTF?!<br /><br />So you need almost 4 GB of free space just to get started! This is nuts for a mobile game. And my device is not a tiny Android device. It's a 16 GB Galaxy S3 (when factory new, it has just 11 GB free), but still, that's way too much.<br /><br />So I finally didn't check the game out, sorry. But be warned you need a lot of space to play this!	3
3559980	This app sucks it is a bunch of bs I mean wtf it does not work it will not down load on to my kindle	1
3562622	super fun and delfinitely makes the time pass. it says I need to write more about this app...wtf..there shouldn't be minimum words to write about an app...its fun and runs great on my Samsung galaxy s3 =P	5
3567287	$hould be free...already is free...wtf is there anything horrifyingly brilliantly ghastly about this calc or have i stumbled upon a wonderful new app?	5
3567947	This game is okay. It has the same gameplay and rules of the real card game.<br />ALTHOUH, this is NOT the full game. It is only a trial. You must pay $10 for the full version. WTF!?	3
3573009	As a player of the Sims freeplay app and this, they both have the same concept. That being said, both games get highly boring after a while.<br />-You start out with money in the bank under nothing more than 300 (depending in the character) , then they give you money for goals getting around 400.<br />-I looked through the characters for 20 minutes trying to find one I liked<br />-The character is waaaayyyy to needy. I end up spending all my money trying to get it grocies so it could quit complaining and eat.<br />-The adult size beds are 800$?! How am I suppose to pah for that?! My character is tired and I cant do anything! So I ended up buying a discount children's bed for less than 100 (wtf?!). The character went to sleep, I left the game so it could sleep and I didn't have anything to do anyways. I come back and she is still awake a still very tired.<br />-The money you get and the time spent trying to get the money is not the same as the prices. For example, for a a weeks worth of working I could finally buy a bed. That's a little stupid. That being said...I think salary and prices are a bit ridiculous. In the Sims Freeplay, yeah the prices are a bit overpriced but a least you can make the money doing multiple and effective things.<br /><br />BUT<br /> I do really like the concept of the game. I like growing my own family, the life like things they do (play games, floss teeth, etc.). And the fact that they get sick and need medicine is really cool. Ive been waiting for a virtual world where people got sick...it makes it interesting.<br />Like I said, the concept is GREAT but the salary made and the prices don't match.	4
3574037	THERE'S ONLY LIKE 5 DINOSAURS WTF DATS MESSED UP I MEAN C'MON PEOPLE ADD MORE DINOSAURS PLEASE NOT THAT FUN	1
3575372	This game gets me dizzy :( I'm still searching fora spin art and i want to pay now like  the buttons to small it is NOT SPIN ART IT REALLY MADE ME PUKE come on my sister who is 5 was like wtf this aint fun	1
3581934	It's a good game, much the same as many of the other logo icon quizzes available but some don't make sense.... for example snoop lion WTF!!! :/	2
3588541	At first it was a little confusing, and I was like wtf, but after awhile I got it, it's actually pretty easy to use now. The icons are great I recommend getting this app, it's really cool :)	4
3588755	"i opened this payanywhere account for my fence installation business. With my business i make regular transactions weekly ranging from $350 to $10,000. Most of my customers pay with check, but occasionally i would have a request to pay via card, enough so that it warranted me to explore options to process cards. Heres what happened. i open a payanywhere account, and make my first (and what was to be only) card transaction in the amount of $735. Payanywhere had set my high purchase limit at $20 so the purchase flagged the account and my deposit was held. i called in and they requested paperwork which i immediately sent. Payanywhere said i would have a resolution in 48hrs. 5 days later my customer calls in a panic because pay anywhere call her and said she should physically have the fence material she purchased,(the material she purchased takes 3weeks to build and ship which she was informed of when she purchased it from me) She said she now felt something was wrong with her purchase and wanted to pull out of the contract. i had to drive out to meet her and talk her down. i called payanywhere and asked WTF? they said sorry we will fix this in (another 48hrs) 5 more days (10 total now) they still didn't call. i called in asked for a manager which they said would call me. that never happened. the next day (day 11) a rep called and said \\""good news, your money has been deposited and we moved up your high purchase amount to $1000\\"" i said, my next transaction is going to be $2500! they said \\""break it up into 3 purchases (1000,1000,&500)\\"" I said \\""close my account and go Fly a KITE\\""<br />this company is horrible, slow to react, and disorganized, find a better option, there are many others to choose from!"	1
3590803	I bought a year's subscription to Real Simple with my Coke Rewards, but I need some stupid app to see it (WTF?) So I search for it on my PC, it says Kindle Tablet not Kindle Fire and it is not compatible with my device, despite the description on the MCR page saying my digital subscription is compatible with the Fire. I tried to find it in the App store on my Kindle Fire, and could not find it. I spent 400 points on something that I can't even use!! Someone lied to me, either Amazon or Coke, and I am beyond P.O.'ed. I guess I'll spend the rest of my points on sweepstakes I'll probably never win. FML!	1
3594012	One of the worst games ever it sucks I alredy deleted it and the game was horrible I was excited to get it but I played and I'm like wtf is this the deleted it	1
3595922	this is bascically just worldcraft but for a bigger price. Do not waste your money. Buy worldcraft which is lower and has survival in it! They stole worldcrafts style and made it their own. WTF!	1
3601665	i cant even figure out how to use it wtf some app you need to be a computer tech wtf	1
3607156	You start playing the game. You think, hey this is kind of fun. After a while, everything you created disappears. IT COMPLETELY VANISHES!!! I built a castle. It took me hours to build it. I exited the game. Came back the next day, IT WAS GONE! WTF?! That needs to be fixed immediately.	1
3608300	This is not the salon game. It's. a &quot;Avoid the germs&quot;. Wtf! Unfortunately the developer. did not realize its the wrong game. I guess........	1
3608987	When I got this I played it then when I went to play a different game I went back to this app and I had to start all over and I'm like WTF is wrong with thus app and I just deleted it cause it mad me start it all over	1
3609912	I bought this game almost 2 years ago... still cant get past snow'or. wtf. update the game already!!! it is a really awesome game but please update it.	5
3609948	If you take pride in your talents in art, but am a lousy photographer, like me, you'll get a real kick out of this app. You'll have fun sending email photos to your friends knowing they'll be saying WTF ???	5
3610117	Well its ok but you should have more emoticons there like why isnt there a WTF for ballon kind or why is there certent kind of emoticon for each one you should show the same kind of emotions for each emoticon	4
3613172	Can't use it to watch ESPN3. A lot of aps don't work on android. WTF? I want to use my Kindle for more than stupid games!	1
3614523	A few months back i downloaded this. Awesome. Amazing. Loved the multiplayer. So, in clearing up some space and all that, i deleted that. Now i come back to download it, and guess what? Apparently I dont have &quot;The updated version&quot; and i can't play multiplayer. WTF? Amazon...update this....please....	1

3621276	I love this game! whenever I'm feeling sad this game is funny as hell! plz I begged u play this game! a gorilla? wtf! lil hahaha!!!!!	5
3626705	So far its done nothing. i dont understand how it works. I'm not getting any. WTF? What's the secret to getting the free apps?	1
3632984	Lets me switch accounts easy, easy to use, and a great way to see cats, rage comics, and wtf images.	5
3635081	"This game is so annoying!!!  And it expects you to spend money to \\""buy\\"" things!!!  WTF!?  Don't waste your money or your sanity!"	1
3635452	A very impressive interface left me asking WTF?! I couldn't tell how to perform the simplest function. Poor, poor design, at least for the uninitiated. Operations are not intuitive nor could I find help or instruction. The demo tells me how &quot;cool&quot; this application is. No, it's not. It's only &quot;cool&quot; if the application can actually be used. The options suggests this is a pretty comprehensive package but I couldn't figure out how to use any of it. Too bad. It seemed promising.	1
3639678	There is no way to update this game. You tell us we need to update but dont provide a wy to do it. Wtf.	3
3641784	At first, when I bought it, it was great. But when I but the full version, I was ecstatic! Then, when I woke up, I went on here to play, and every thing was locked up again! I was like, WTF? This game is cool, but it stole my money for the full version. Try Sims, there way better, and free.	2
3644013	enjoy this game, except I'm being frugal with my coin earnings and every time my kindle (1st gen fire) restarts, the app reinstalls and I lose all my coins. this morning I opened the app up to discover I had lost 150k coins. Wtf guys. without this bug it'd be 5 stars, but this is a big pain to have to build up my bank every other day.	3
3649245	It's a really fun game and all but when I started to play after a while I couldn't press anything...... Wtf?...	5
3656007	I dl'd this when it was the free app of the day a while back, and it was working fine for a 6 months. Today I updated it and it just says &quot;Error&quot; when I hit print!!! WTF!!	1
3656470	omg wtf this game is such a ripoff bcuz the picture is not right please don't by this game if you do your woo dumb	1
3662825	This thing is a rip of when you try to do something it will have some policy pop up when you cancel out of it it will go to the internet wtf it douse it over and over fix please	1
3663418	The game that never gets old and makes me feel young again, back to the days of memory. Then there are those tiles that match and you have to sit back and say, WTF?? How does that match? I've just wasted ten minutes staring at this screen and you tell me that those two tiles match?? Fun	5
3668157	There were already enough problems with this app that I didn't like and then they went and took the one feature I loved away! To make matters worse they showed their complete stupidity by adding a delete transaction button! WTF??? Do they think it will actually delete the transactions? Let's see how that works for the millions of morons out there!	2
3678960	I want my $.99 back! Wtf? Everyone knows how this if they have expired their Kindle. I relize you have to compete so it's not possible to download anything associated with google. But I felt thickened like maybe there was some secret was I could use Google apps.	1
3679172	WTF I got this game because I like ''cut the rope'' but when I open the game it freezes. P.S somebody please tell the creator to fix this game.But once again WTF.	2
3682498	The controls are complicated and people are flying on jetpacks and like WTF but overall it's good, a game recommend get Modern Combat 4 Zero Hour it's awesome but seriously it's cool it's like HALO except cooler vehicles	3
3685721	I AM SICK AND TIRED of stupid apps thinking they can put out bad quality products riddled with typos and not even fun. This is a rip off 4 pics 1 word. Haha even the ads have typos wtf!?!???	2
3695075	I have not downloaded a single app or video or whatever yet this game says it needs me to delete 144 Mb of data to work. Then after I deleted Pandora and stuff it says it still needs 144 Mb. WTF.	1
3696191	I was so excided to get it because I have netflix at my house and I couldn't wait! but hen it said pass and email and I was like WTF I don't know my pass. sooooooooo	1
3698763	All of those low rates... WTF?? This is the best app EVER u can listen to sooo much diffrent music!!! All of u haters have a bad taste in apps!!	5
3699264	Okay:WTF IS THIS????? This game is so stupid that I think it gave me cancer. All you do is fling a bunch of stupid junk and an idiot who by all rights needed to flogged and shot! Despite being free it is difficult to play without fishing around in your wallet for enough money to buy more junk to fling at that idiot. I hate this game and hope its creators are hanging themselves for making this stupid horrible game!!!	1
3703651	"My wife has a Note II and played 94 Seconds a lot. After a couple of weeks, her phone notified her that this app had used 1GB of data in the last week and looking at her usage online, she had used 1GB per week since she downloaded the app. This is not really a problem since we have unlimited data, but I couldn't imagine why the app would use so much data. Before she downloaded it, she was using around 50 to 100MB data per month.<br /><br />I emailed the company and their response was along the lines of: \\""She must play a lot of games. She could put the phone in airplane mode so she would not use any data while she played.\\"" In other words, the games does not require an online connection, but if you have one it will transfer gigs of data. I thought, \\""WTF?\\""<br /><br />I asked this question on XDA and got no response. But the reviewers on Amazon come through! Now I know that this malware was busy mining and transferring the data on her phone while she played. But, I still cannot give the app one star since she did love to play it."	2
3703704	i have played the game before i loved it i bought it just to came to a notice that i dont own the game but i just bought it WTF.	4
3703994	DUDE THIS GAME ROCKS.there every thing you can barter you can laugh.at first i said WTF but it got reely like this game. pepole need to make games games more like this. BEST GAME EVER	5

3711272	okayyyy whats going on here on iphone the first two heros cost 1200 and 1500 on here they cost 1500 and 2500 WTF?	4
3712211	Omg stupidest app evaaaaaaaa! Thought I was gonna play some awesome slots on this app but turns out all it is is pictures of different slot games that you try and name correctly- wtf is that about!?!?!?! Again cant stress this enough- STUPID!!!! Cant believe I wasted money on this. Hope I save some of you folks from doing the same :)	1
3714405	I signed up for this to catch live away games, only to find out after naming my favorite team - - it was blacked out.  WTF?	1
3718696	Used to be a great app! I liked getting the manga that only came out in digital format and read on my phone, loved it! But now ever since I let it update it shows up the manga pages two at a time on the screen, one above the other. Each page is only about an inch wide and 1.5 inches tall. Like I can read that! Having to touch and zoom in each page just isn't worth it. And also like everyone else has said it now takes up about 30 MB. 30 Mb wasted because now I can't even read my manga. Uninstalling. Thank God I still have the older version on my tablet. This is very disappointing. WTF Amazon?<br /><br />Unless anyone else with this problem has figured out a setting or something to fix it? (If so, please let me know) I can't seem to find a way to change it.	1
3728855	I'm 12 years old, guess what, it said I would lived to be 11 wtf but lol its so bad but funny	5
3728879	"Hell No,I only installed the Amazon App Store App to get my Spurs theme ! Now it \\""doesn't work without Amazon app installed on phone.\\"" WTF ."	2
3736160	downloaded from apstore, goto login and say needs client update but no way to update and same versio  in store. wtf someone get there ass on the ball..	1
3736811	Wtf it just takes me to my minecraft pocket edition app ripoff and by the way wtf is this..... please don't tell me it was a wast because I think it was	2
3741087	i had 11 parks spaces and almost all my ppl hired. went back on it today and only had 4 parks and no one hired. wtf happened to all that work i put into this stupid game?	2
3741126	This is a fairly fun app and ok for entertainment purposes, but it lacks necessary, and contains certain silly functions that diminish the experience.<br /><br />What is lacking? Most glaring is the lack of a replay button to review the last hand. The hands flash-end so quickly that you often never know what the other players may have been chasing, over-betting etc., with. The provided statistics in the free version are almost useless.<br /><br />What it has that it should lose? Dealer tip button, makes you think the random deal software is biased, and why would anyone be tipping a software dealer anyway? Buying silly icon gifts for other players...get real! I have idiots buying me teddy bears, and energy drinks, wtf!  You are assigned silly names depending on how many hands you have played, having absolutely no relation to actual win/loss rates.<br /><br />...and of course, as with any free play site, you get more than your share of morons pushing with Q3, and cracking your AA.<br /><br />Real money poker is coming soon, and if WSOP has any intention of getting in on the money it needs to change from fluff and foolishness, to real poker utility.	3
3750788	So I paid $2.99 for this and can't even use it as it's not compatible with kindle fire? WTF, why don't they tell you before download!?	1
3755504	"I was not impressed when I first loaded this app on the prompting from my copy of Handwrite Pro, and my first attempt to use it resulted in a display screen showing my Kindle's file system.<br /><br />Seriously, WTF? Has this thing just installed a hucking fuge back door into my beloved slab? Who knows, because there is nothing in the way of explanations or instructions, nor could I locate The Fine Manual in order to Read it.<br /><br />The learning curve on this app is steep, but appreciably less steep if you own and can use Handwrite, a job made less simple than it might be thanks to the author silently downloading updates that changed the behavior of the user interface. Yes it became more useful, but it took me several minutes and a ruined document or two to relearn skills I'd invested time learning already.<br /><br />Like all software, once you get your own head into the same space the designer's is you have an easier time. The interface becomes somewhat instructive if you have the patience to poke at it for a while, and it can be provoked to become more helpful once you understand the way it works, but it still is problematic to use with a finger, for the same reasons Handwrite is. Screen so small, fingers so fat.<br /><br />Small screen means you must learn how to trigger the screen slide behavior, and doing so without introducing a blemish on the document is beyond my skills.<br /><br />Fat finger means that what is being drawn is obscured by the finger to the point that accuracy becomes an issue for example when trying to close up a loop so it can be color filled. I haven't found a stylus that works well on the Kindle.<br /><br />Technically, the app has a problem with the color fill identifying the true edge of the bounding line, which can leave small amounts of the background color peeping through that must be dealt with by painting with the brush.<br /><br />The app could use a library of selectable shapes too, shapes that could be scaled and deformed after dropping them into the picture.<br /><br />And it definitely could do without that truly worrying \\""expose the file system\\"" bug.<br /><br />[EDIT 5/14/13] Another less-than-useful \\""feature\\"" I've discovered the hard way is that in order to get any sort of fine detail one must zoom the page and reduce the brush size. About 400% zoom is right for me with a brush size approaching 2-3 pixels. When the Kindle is turned from portrait to landscape in order to draw a long stroke without the need to drag the paper, the zoom reverts back to 100%. Not helpful.<br /><br />I'd really like to know what the gleeful four- and five-star reviewers are actually using this app for. The edge fill problem should be a show-stopper for any serious art user and this daft rezoom issue prevents it being really useful as a technical sketch board. I want to draw floor plans, furniture designs, electric circuits and the like, and the app fights me.[/EDIT]<br /><br />[EDIT 11/18/13] If the designer is auditing these reviews I'd like to emphasize the things that (in my opinion) need attention:<br /><br />1) Fill behavior not optimal, with gaps in the fill at the edges of an enclosing loop.<br />2) The magnifier should default to under and to the left of the stylus for right handed people, and be switchable for left handers (It is currently over the stylus point which means the stylus is blocking the line of sight to it). The magnifier should move upward when it is about to wander off-screen.<br />3) Reorienting the device should not affect the zoom.<br /><br />Nicest things to add would be shape libraries and line smoothing, which I would pay for.

3761481	Ok firstly wtf good play through until the last 3 levels insanely hard (I had every upgrade on the best chars and weps) but guarantee worst I think it would be awesome if you would get coin for killing people n endless but no u get major coinage in story but then you get pretty much nothin In endless. Now for good stuff great graphics movie quotes and easy controls. Bad farrrrrrrly out weighs the good in my opinion.	3
3762298	don't waste your time downloading it!!!! It told me the password to my Wi-Fi password was bunnies!wtf my password was longer and had numbers&letters	1
3762490	"Of all the boxing timer apps amazon has to offer, this seemed like the best one for what I need. HOWEVER!! Like the rest of the apps from here, you have to be online in order to use use them!!!! What a bunch of effin crap!!! So what's the purpose of even downloading and PAYING for these stupid things when they can't work??? What really annoys me, is how this app used to work with no connection at all!! But now I get something like, \\""must be online in order to use this app\\"" or \\""internal error\\""!!!! WTF??????? Not only am I fully disappointed with this app, but also the kindle!!!!!! Hopefully, I'll remedy this stupid issue once I get my new IPad set-up...the kindle is going in the TRASH!!!!!!"	2
3763769	omfg this game is really wierd like wtf is.going on?!?!?! as soonas i played it once it was deleted and i would NEVER reccomend this app to anyone	3
3765721	games great i'ma having so much fun now wtf I get for writing this crap. darnit I have to type more	5
3766151	I havent played sims since sims 2 when I had a pc, I downloaded this on my kindle thinking it was like that and this is just like a farmville ish type game, takes a long time, need to pay for gems or whatever to get stuff, and need nieghbors :(( wtf mate, I wish there was an actually sims like game available-this isnt that fun- also whats with the needing to level up to build more ar add more people? annoying game actually I barely want to give it 3 stars now that I actually think about it...	3
3776814	I understand they need the ads that appear between each turn to pay for the game; no problem. What<br />the HELL is up with these commercials they have started playing???  Not only do these commercial slow the system down because you have to wait for them to load, you are FORCED to endure them because you cannot stop them.  If I wanted to watch videos, I would look at tv or Netflix - I would NOT be playing Scramble With Friends!  WTF!!!!!	1
3777252	guys it says it is only pictures in the discription don't be all like WTF it clearly States pictures only as I said before	5
3779852	this game is mickey mouse!! i bought it and then it says i cant install it!!! WTF THIS IS STUPID!	1
3782729	Not sure how to figure out what these stupid looking icons freaking mean! I still don't understand these stupid icons/picture slash IDK WTF they are yet! :/	4
3785173	Hey!! Why did I NOT get a new game when I completed my first game?!! All I ever received was a notice that a new game would be coming sooon! And I never got a new game to play!! so dissapointed! I played this game on my Kindle Fire and a new game NEVER loaded! WTF?!!	3
3787849	the program stops and cuts off. i had to learn the hard way. i had to start my paper all over again then save it every few minutes because it kept kicking me out wtf.	1
3802477	Used to work great now it wont open. :(<br />I see a lot of other people on here are having this issue too wtf.	1
3803447	Most of the sounds are cheesy to the point where you just sit there thinking &#34;Wtf??&#34; Not scary at all...Just annoyed	1
3805873	This app has so much promise, but since the last update it's become so buggy that it's hardly worth opening. For instance, what prompted me to write this review: no matter how many times I try to open a new post, it keeps opening the last one I read. I'm sure I'll find a work around, or it'll suddenly start working correctly again, but I'm getting tired of these bugs. Also, in the middle of reading something, it'll suddenly require me to log in again, losing what I was reading in the process. Wtf? I can't imagine it would be of much value if you found yourself offline and mistakenly assumed you could read your content offline, much as I do on other readers. Because, you know, I can't login to google reader when I'm offline, and this stupid app won't let me read anything until I've logged in again. And this happens several times a day, at a minimum. Again, wtf?	2
3807225	Got this when it was faotd and you gotta pay to play the whole game. Wtf. Don't bother unless you want to buy it.	1
3811590	Similar in build to the Comedy Film Nerds app (see my other review) and the WTF w/Marc Maron app.  The framework is identical, in fact.  The only reason it got a 4/5 is the lesser amount of extras per episode.  Works well and the ability to download the episodes for playback when wi-fi or 4g connection isn't available is excellent.  The best alternative for those not using iOS or itunes downloads.	4
3812736	Omg its so stupid how I cant post pods! WTF! what's tthe point if we cant even post pics or take them down	3
3813282	I love the game. hate the software.  keeps failing and having to be reinstalled.  got the paid app to avoid ads.  still getting ads...  WTF!!!  fix this game please....	4
3817635	This app worked at first but it wouldn't load the newsfeed... or anything else on my kindle fire and now I can't even uninstall it wtf?! I'm irritated by it and quite cranky. This is very low grade and awful quality	1
3819074	I bought 5 mp3 songs thinking that I.could download them onto my HTC amaze to my disbelief,I wasn't able to search for my recently bought amazon mp3 songs with the  cloud  I can play them on the pc laptop but not the amaze ,wtf ,when  I try to search for help it would skip over this & the cloud would be blank ,too many bugs	1
3828422	This would be great to play, if you couldn't sleep at night.<br />It is nothing like minecraft or temple run. First off, nothing is chasing you, second, there are no coins, and finely....... WTF IS WITH THE COWS!!!	1
3830596	Purchased the upgrade to version 9 a year and a half ago to get the Live Access app (with no monthly fees).  At the time they said they would not charge for the feature or, if they did, it would be about $2 per month after the first year.<br /><br />Iris is now going to turn that feature completely off unless we pay for the upgrade to version 10 ($1200) AND we now must pay $9 PER MONTH PER STYLIST to continue using the Live Access app.<br /><br />We ALREADY PAID for this feature and now you want to turn it off unless we pay an additional $1200 + $2300 per year in fees?!  WTF!<br /><br />Oh, and my favorite part is that the Live Access feature often does not work (Google it, you'll see the complaints).<br /><br />When you post a comment on their Facebook page regarding problems with the software they just delete it so people who are considering a purchase of the software see nothing but positive comments.  Go ahead - try to post something about a problem and see how fast they take it down.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE IRIS SOFTWARE!!	1
3832932	I saw the paid version of this and didn't want to buy anything. My friend showed me the free version and I was both disappointed and amazed<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />* If you have an invaluable item like dirt or wood, you can easily turn it into 5 stacks . of diamond<br />*You can see how many mobs of which kind are in your world. Very useful for mob hunting<br />*Can change location (x,y,z)<br />*You can change the gamemode and time of day<br />*Super easy to use for pocket edition. It connects automatically without any logins, internet, or crashing.<br /><br />Bad<br /><br />*When I downloaded it the first time, I got a error message that said , Unable to install, app has been corrupted. Wtf??<br />*Cant spawn any mobs. It should allow us to spawn at least chickens or zombies.<br /><br />Altogether, its a pretty cool app. I reccomend it to those who cant find a single diamond even if they stay up late trying.<br /><br />My hopes for the future are that they would add texture packs and skins. Its a great app though. no regrets installing it!!!	4
3834193	I got rid of every single app or piece of media on this stupid thing but I still don't have enough memory. What am I doing wrong huh? I mean really wtf! Ive lost everything for this app.	1
3835151	I have no idea why anyone gave this game five stars. it's terrible. they want you to find anagrams yet some of the &quot;anagrams&quot; are one letter. wtf? seriously?! its boring and repetitive. at least come up with new words to find. I knew who the killer was on the second day but couldn't arrest them. 1 star that's it. its a waste of space and the five star reviews are probably fake.	1
3838467	SUCKS! Doesn't work on Kindle Fire. Info I could have used at time of purchase. BS gonna turn me into a trekkie WTF!	1
3839569	you ono I don't even understand y so many people make or check reviews on a game so popular that all u have to do is search and download. Now don't get me because there r some games like this one with pictures that hav absolutely nothing to do with the word. some of r just ridiculous like &quot;handpalm&quot; like wtf is that! Who says that!	5
3839642	most of the time i love playing this but once in a while i get stuck on a picture of something that has NOTHING to do with the word Ex 1: pic of elephants eating grass-word was winter?!?!? WTF?!?!? Ex 2: a pic of a teacher pointing at the globe - word was train?!?!? ....so if you want a word that acually goes woth the pic choose Guess The Word!!! its awesome! XP	3
3841315	Amazing game. Love the sea and land parks. But whats the point of calling it a DNA expedition in the sea park after the first 10 expeditions i got 3 out of it but 20 more after i got no DNA, WTF!!!!	5
3845367	Fun game with good graphics, but the game keeps clutching out on me. Today for like the third time the game reset itself and I lost all of my progress when I was up to the tiger shark. WTF?! If that were fixed, I would give 5 stars.	3
3846742	Hey man! you can't go taking the railroads and utilities away, WTF! Bring em back!<br />other than that, this is a good monopoly game, I like the ambient music, the feel to the game, it is awesome, but the railroads, and utilities make the game fun because of their added value	5
3849924	This game, an elegant mix between Skyrim and World of Warcraft, is most likely the best it's going to get until we have at least double processing speed on mobile devices. It's an amazing game, worth the money ten times over, that fantasy and RPG lovers will hold close- not to their hearts, but to their controllers. The graphics are early PS2, and, sure- they're not the best graphics as far as Tablet and phone games go, but the gameplay makes up for it, with large enough world to warrant hours and hours of gametime, the many class/race combinations adding some replay value as well.<br /><br />The story is interesting, albeit a little clich&eacute;, though the numerous side quests make up for it.<br /><br />The graphics, as I said, are a bit lacking, with low texture resolutions sometimes standing out against an expertly made landscape, or the other way around. That can be annoying, but other than that, you'll still be impressed by what modern technology is capable of.<br /><br />The little details, such as interesting little features that surprise you and make you think just about every time- &quot;Hey, that's cool!&quot; or even &quot;That's a really innovative idea!&quot; are always there, through every step of the game.<br /><br />On the other hand, you'll have your fair share of &quot;What?! That's retarded!!&quot; and even a few rage quits. There aren't too many, but they usually end up in dungeons, caves, caverns, etc., at the boss, as most of the earlier bosses are overpowered beyond all reason. (No joke, on my second character I'm still stuck on Chief Kargath.)<br /><br />All in all, I gave this game 4 stars, considering the graphics and gameplay weren't all that bad when you happen to accidentally find most of the &quot;WTF&quot; moments toward the beginning.<br /><br />(Kindle Fire HD)	4
3857434	I might have liked this if there were just some instructions! it looked like a great game but I need to know wtf everything dose! it would be a good app if they fixed this	1
3870993	It's ok. I downloaded this app. for the big bucks. It was suppose to give them to me once I reached a certain level. I've surpassed the level and I'm still waiting for my big bucks. I feel suckered. This is the second app to do this....WTF?	3
3872289	imnpretty sure I have everything correct. and I checked dish.com and its in the kindle store. but I cant download at all.  keep getting a message that says and error has occurred. cant download file.  wtf.!!	1
3874830	nah seriously. wtf? like wat is this even about am I a loop or Why am I falling huh tell meeeeee	1
3875866	I'm a big fan of Amazon.com but this app is embarrassing and really not worth the effort.<br /><br />First of all, the app would not install on my android tablet or on my Kindle 8.9 HD.  REALLY?  Not even on a Kindle?  The app did install on my android phone but when I tried to activate a promo coupon, the screens would not load even after multiple tries.  Says the screens are not available.  WTF?<br /><br />I deleted the app from my phone and will not try to load it on to my tablets in the future.  The app also required a lot of permissions which I feel were unnecessary and may possibly be security liabilities.<br /><br />Amazon, if you have an app that's not ready for prime time then don't release it.  Doing so makes you look incompetent and unreliable -- which IMO, you do at this point in time.  You can/should do better.	1
3880546	If u live in America u have to look everything up...90% of the logos are european!!! Wtf but ive spent all day on it goohling from the clues...and now I'm out of clues...	2
3888710	"Used to be the shizzle for the phone.  Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream.  WTF?  And to boot, they're now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month.  I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc.  40 hrs is a few days for me.<br /><br />As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads.  You have far too much competition for this crap!<br /><br />Now, for the pc review.  On the pc you don't experience the above issues however, there's still a lot of ads.  UNLESS . . .  you know a trick, like I do.  And yes, it's completely legal.<br /><br />For your home pc, Google \\""Adam Haile Elpis\\"".  Click on the first hit.  Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora.  In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora.  Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things.  1- it allows you to have unlimited skips.  2- it will not download any ads.  In other words, it simulates the pay service.<br /><br />YOU'RE WELCOME!!!"	2
3889346	I cant even use the store items I bought or do anything to the zombie cant walk it cant move it cant do anything but go like this *poke poke poke* wtf did I even get this game before reading the comments cant it be like nintendogs but for zombies now thats a game ide spend money for	1
3889576	it wont let me photo blog or upload a new photo wtf i click continue and it stays there what should i do?	2
3898094	The game itself is fun and all (minus the iap, I always resent that when devs find it necessary) but wtf are those permissions?! Why does a simple game need to read logs if not to get at information it shouldn't? Thinking about deleting solely for that reason.	3
3903663	this game is sooooo stupid cuz like i was trying to get paased a level --- which i thought i did since i was the biggest, but it said my life was terminated!! like wtf!? i have a lot of patience but this game is just annoying!! stop listning to the other reviews, this game sucks!! i uninstalled it. dont get this game!!!	1
3908236	Sucked. too many things included with the app. not worth your time, slows down the phone. wtf dude. too much bs.	1
3910671	It's okay but the last girl has terrible clothes. She has 3 hoodie dresses, 3 hoodies, 2 skirts and shorts that look like underwear. Wtf?	4
3911714	It was working fine but now I can just take pics but I can not make a video... wtf why? Every time I click on make a video it says (stopped working) why? Can I get my money back?	1
3915888	All you do is just sit around and get killed in 5 seconds. This game sucks don't buy it and zombies on the friggin moon? Wtf is with that?	1
3919179	NOT scary, NOT fun, JUST BORING, BORING, BORING.  Could not delete this garbage fast enough.  Ignore these phony positive reviews from Digital Code Works employees.<br /><br />There are no instructions, controls are impossible, graphics are horrible, entire game is incredibly stupid and absolutely pointless.  Even the music is a poorly executed playback loop.  WTF AMAZON!!!	1
3920296	I bought the entire deluxe game and allbof a sudden, its telling me to rebuy! terrible! I already paid. bulls***. really fun game, but wtf. would like to have what I already paid for, is that asking too much? also freezes on some of the screens.	2
3920791	I was lucky enough to get this game for free but I would say it is definetly worth a dollar. this game is isn't a going to make u wanna throw ur device away from u scary but more like a &quot;wtf just happened&quot; or &quot;he just came from nowhere&quot; scary. worth playing if fan of slendy, scathe games, or just bored and want something to play.<br /><br />Ps. if u want to make the game scarier change the difficulty setting (duh) or add fog/image enhanced thing.	4
3920933	this is so creaky I mean look at the reviews when I saw the reviews I wanted to see for myself. it scared the crap out of me. WTF!!!!!!	5

3939162	i hats this game now my brow thinks hes an actual zombie killer in real life like wtf seriously!!!!!!!!!!!! s***	1
3941108	I use to love this game before the update. Before the update you could play for as long as you wanted until you ran out of money, now you only get to play for like 10 minutes and then it says &quot;you have ran out of energy, would you like to buy some?&quot; And then it has to recharge for 120 minutes. WTF!!!	2

Please refer to the terms of use for this product to determine the geographical restrictions.<br /><br />WTF? I'm in Norway. We do the pushups here too.	5
3942379	The very first day got this game it crashed! ,l mean WTF!.<br />it.may work fine for other people's tablets but not for mine.<br />The first few hours l actually had access to it, it  l still had problems.<br />But since this app works fine for everyone else, l guess l still<br />suggest getting it. Because it was pretty cool when it worked<br />for me.	1
3943094	I don't have this app lol<br /> wtf am I doing<br />well I think its BAD GOOD<br />BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA	1
3946073	I loved this app. and played, played, played,  until today,  I was almost to last shark and bought jewels and $$ from store,  put game aside and when I tried to play again, all my newly bought jewels and $$ was gone and was back at beginning .......WTF???? there is no way to contact so I'm screwed!!!!	2
3950796	not worth your time playing let alone downloading this game.  every other puzzle makes no sense. ie: a gift,  a cup of coffee,  football player,  and a Peron with a red backpackers ... answer : backpack,  wtf?	1
3951881	this app sucks i hot it  and i was like wtf is this do not get im sry i really hate this app	1

3971051	their customer service is even more of a joke...thier game locks up a lot and even forces you to redownload the game....and if u do that ALL data is gone and they don't care if u spent money to obtain cards or other items...they still wont return or refund..and saving data is useless since u have to redownload it from their &quot;save&quot; server cud then when u bring it back up from there...its no longer saved...I mean really wtf com2us	1
3971933	would be better if I didn't have to use my snowflakes all at once it should give you the option but it doesn't you have to use them or uoh cant move on and then it says rate us five stars to get a update wtf you should be able to rate it and still get the update that's not right for the company's to do that.	5
3980537	This game is cool but the only thing is that you only get 15 ta20 min to play it it's stupid and its ex post to be survivalcraft and you die wtf man	1
3981926	got really far and it decided to not save my progress....  wtf?<br /><br />i do not approve of these shenanigans, go blow a goat.	1
3984928	i bought the game and just like everyone else here, i was unable to download it (kindle fire) i went back today to try it again and it says i need to buy it again? wtf!?	1
3986489	"I absolutely love Snark Busters 1 & 2. So you can imagine what happened when I found out Snark Busters 3 was coming down the pipeline. (I danced long into the night. At one point the neighbors asked me to lower the volume on my Techno music. I told them to, \\""suck it.\\"" Filthy communists.) Anyway it turns out the new game isn't compatible on my non-HD Kindle Fire.<br /><br />WTF?!? Seriously?!? When did I become less valuable as a customer? When I didn't want to purchase the HD because: a) my Kindle Fire is in excellent condition and/or b) I didn't feel I should have to pay extra for an ad free HD?<br /><br />So, I should purchase a Nook and stop ordering from Amazon?  Unbelievable.<br /><br />UPDATE: I purchased a NOOK and buy all of my games through Google now. This game was only \\""Meh.\\"" Not as good as 1 & 2 and I prefer to locate my hidden objects without the items appearing in circle clusters. I believe Alawar can do better."	3
3993374	so I'm playing this game and for some reason it doesn't let me open the app up wtf is that?	4
3994255	Itz good needs difrent on scren controls and the enemies should have the same wepons as u unlocked not the best stuff right when u start the game like wtf were u thinkin	5
3996013	This is pretty good but just one thing,on my country station an Eminim song came up and I was like wtf? Other than that I love it, got it on my computer and my Andriod tablet. When I upgrade my car stereo it' s going there too.	4
3997177	I have a kindle fire, loved the game, recommended it to my boyfriend. later I started finding out about all these features he gets that I don't! Bigger castle upgrades, two extra islands I can't buy, and even a daily scratch card! WTF, devs? Please catch the kindle users all the way up and fast. I have spent money on this game.	3
3997609	this game sucks...... screen freezes and sometimes it doesn't even load... Screen flashs cant even play it at all...  WTF a waste of 3 dolars	1
3998657	for what I used it for I didn't like it. value espected? Wtf. other than that it was fine. Not excactly 5 star worthy.	4
4000919	I've never played it. So I can't really review it now can I?<br /><br />Wtf amazon? Still it's a game that's had good reviews, but based on a Disney Movie. I don't recall any temples in the movie. Kind of odd. But hey maybe it works?<br /><br />Try it and see. It's probably free or 99 cents. You'll play it for a few days maybe weeks then forget you ever installed it.	1
4000929	I WANT MY 5 DOLLARS BACK. I bought a 50 pack of gems..I bought nothing except I saved myself from dying 4 times and now I have 19 left. WTF is that??? Its a fun game but the money sucking bs has to go. Deleting from all 9 of our devices and posting it all over DO NOT BUY	1
4002546	click close apps, it will say it closed 46 apps. click it again it says no apps closed click it again 49 apps closed...wtf? if it closed the apps then they should be closed till you open them again. and at no time have I ever opened 49 apps on my phone at the same time, I don't even own 49 apps	1
4005451	I have it linked up to my Facebook account ! Instead of my picture default from Facebook showing on the screen when I'm playing with my high score it has a picture of one of my friends from Facebook that has it linked up to his with his high score!! Why? Wtf! Please fix this !	1
4011114	A granny came in with a celebrity and just stood there. She would not leave even after the store closed, so I couldn't get to the next level!!! WTF!!! Please fix ASAP!! >:-/	1
4013664	I can't login with Facebook. Wtf make an update! I can't play with my friends! Only random and it let me play with my Facebook friends before and once I turned it on to start playing it it said could not login through Facebook	3
4018191	this sucks will not update. this needs to be fixed. wtf new game I cant deal with this. I give it a one star now.	1
4028929	Love the game, but I should have paid more attention to the other reviewers. &quot;... incorrectly configured to connect to Facebook.&quot; WTF! $1.99!  The app limitations are my biggest complaint with the Fire HD 8.9. :-(	3
4029164	okay so I just got this app off my cloud and I got nice. I tapped it. not scanned. TAPPED.  And guess what! NAUGHTY! That's the trick. this is crap!!!! they want to make your child feel special by giving them nice. I mean wtf!!!!!!!! don't buy this!!!	1
4035500	I live in south America,  and I can't get any free app. Show me that I need a credit card! WTF! That is because I don't live in USA?	1
4044553	This is an awesome game!!! It's really fun and I wish there was more subway surfer games!  I just wish things aren't so expensive,like for the rio game Carmen is 97000 and we have to make that much money in 24 hours!? Like wtf, but other than that its awesome!	5
4046936	I would say about 50% of the information contained in this app would make a person say OMG wtf.  The rest is general common knowledge information that you may or may not already know.  Either way about 85% of the facts I didn‚Äôt know, and I found the app to be a great read overall.<br /><br />In addition to book marking you can share the facts you like by copying and pasting them into other programs that have editing, and sharing capabilities.<br /><br />It doesn‚Äôt have the ability to read to you like some similar apps I have recently downloaded, but it‚Äôs still worth looking at.	4
4047509	At first, audio and video worked fine.  Then, sometime in December '12, video would not play, just audio.  Then, miraculously, it all worked again.  Today I tried<br />to watch something, and its the same old crap.  No video, just audio. WTF, Netflix?	1
4047745	What's this about not being authorized for playback on a rooted device?!?<br /><br />WTF do you care if my device is rooted NXP?  I could have spent that $1.99 on something I could actually enjoy, like a fountain drink...	1
4051083	"this is one of the reasons why i dont like buying some of these s***ty apps now. cause its a rip off i bought it it downloaded wouldnt install wtf -.-\\"""	1
4059568	Lots of fun until the game force quits my Kindle Fire back to the app carousel midgame. Just got booted from a marathon high score breaking run when I tried to use a 2nd Save Me. Lost my coins from that run and now it says I have -2 gems! WTF? Fix this maddening bug and it's easily 4 or 5 stars.	2
4060695	Sign in errors w/ G Chat. WTF? Please fix asap, and I'll edit this review :)<br />Great idea, poor implementation.	1
4063600	I have been playing Text Twist and Text Twist 2 for several years - since it first came out on Palm - and is one of my favorite, very addictive games. However, this version is quite watered down, and in my opinion, isn't worth paying for with its current functionality. Here are the problems:<br />1. No keyboard support. All letters must be selected via the touch screen. I find this very annoying, as I prefer to use the keyboard. Hey, it's a word game - DUH!<br />2. The touch screen controls are not very responsive. I frequently have to touch the same letter or control repeatedly, for the app to recognize it. I don't have this problem with other apps, so it must be this one.<br />3. The timer stops counting as soon as you guess the biggest word. WTF? How is that a timed game? This is totally different than other versions, including the PC version that I also have.<br />4. They charge twice as much for the Android version, as the iPhone version. Seriously? Does that mean the iPhone version is even worse? I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised to see that it's better.<br />5. After playing a word, the letters get rescrambled when placed back in the row, rather than placing the played word in the row. All previous versions place the word in the row, which makes it easier to replay the word with suffixes on it (such as 's', 'es', 'ed', 'ing', etc...). This is an even bigger flaw considering that you can't use the keyboard to re-key the word.<br /><br />Based on all this, I'd say GameHouse managed to really mess up this one badly. The free version of Jumbline 2 is better, and I'll probably pay for that one to get rid of the ads.	1
4063731	I have been playing this game for over a year now and had no problems. recently I was on level 29 and had to get a new kindle fire so started over at level 1. no big deal I guess. but now I'll plant crops and I'll get an alert to harvest them , I'll go into the game and there are no crops there. wtf how can you earn xp when you cant harvest crops? when fixed I'll give 5 stars	2
4068217	"I want to like this app, really I do, but the publisher makes that very hard to do because of the clunky, non-user-friendly interface.  It's a nice app and I'd use it a lot, except for the bad interface.  For example, let's say I'm watching birds at my feeder and I see three new visitors that I want to make a sighting report for and add to my Life List.  Okay, first I need to click the button for My Content, then the button for Sightings, then the + sign to make a sighting report.  Great, the app lets me use the phone GPS to mark the spot on the map!  Oh, wait, the map is zoomed out to show half the state... did they get it right?  (try to zoom in manually)  Oh no!  As soon as I touched the screen to zoom in it changed the pin position!  Go back, start over, assume the position is correct and hit continue... Oh great, now I have a list of 819 bird species to choose from, with no search function visible.  Aha, there it is, under the options menu \\""advanced search\\"".  \\""Name search: scientific, alternate or common\\""  Oh, this should be easy!  Enter \\""robin\\""... \\""No matching results were found\\""  WTF??  Okay, how about \\""mockingbird\\""... \\""No matching results were found\\""  Okay, obviously that part doesn't work, but I can still search using a lot of criteria, like habitat, regions, colors and size.  Let's try size... \\""About the size of a Robin\\""...  FFFFFFUUUUUU  ($600 cell phone now needs replacement after impacting the bird feeder at high velocity)"	2
4072024	Whenever I try to download it it tells me that it has failed to download. Also it says that yes, I did indeed buy it. WTF why cant I play it then. I'm getting angrier and angrier by the second	1
4075007	it wont download the game wtf don't get it never in your life should you play such a sucky game I have but you shouldn't so stay away from this game and don't get it ever ever ever understand good !!!!!!!!!!!!	1
4075229	Put the dam program on the device- I am not around the 'cloud' very much- it made it to my iPhone ok. WTF?	1
4075872	When my world was loading i saw gangman dude from gangman style. I was like WTF.I also laughed when i saw it.	5
4075875	1. how do you get rid of it of your screen<br />2. AWSOME<br />I pranked my grandma she said wtf how did you break it already God bless a milk cow	5
4078509	I have to think my household isn't the only one with multiple kindles. I say that bc maybe that the issue.  My daughter and I are experiencing this. I collect 2000 while she gets 5000. We got to bed and the next day she's got 1000 and I have 350. Likely a game circle issue not tested when porting app to Amazon platform. Glad we did not have to pay.<br /><br />update Jan 27. started the day with 2300 coins and after one run I now suddenly have 230 coins. wtf?  glitchy app. deleting now.	1
4079530	Y'all got Temple Run 2 quick as sh** but no instagram tho??? -__- its a good app tho but seriously like wtf?	5
4080498	First of all, if you can't read Chinese, DON'T GET THIS GAME, the texts are completely in Chinese so you won't know wtf is going on.  For all you RPG lovers out there that can read Chinese, this game is like the Final Fantasy 7 of Chinese RPGs.  It has all the qualities of a good RPG: great character development, love and romance, a series of mind blowing grand adventures and side quests, great plot twists... etc.  The game play and graphics are slightly out of date and the android controls aren't very well done, but nevertheless it's still very fun.	5
4080604	I TRIED SIGNING UP AND IT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT MY EMAIL AND PICK A USERNAME SO I DID IT AND THEN I CLICKED &quot;GO!&quot; AND IT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A PASSWORD DUDE WTF THERE'S NO WHERE TO PUT A PASSWORD!!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!! IT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR!!!!	1
4081851	WTF I bought call of mini zombies for $0.99 then I have to pay again to upgrade it!!!! Also they are both free on googleplay WTF please treat us kindle users the same..	3
4085369	The first time i played this i was like: wtf is that huge thing chasing me did that combine the other things from the first one into one massive one? lolz but the graphics are really descriptive and the whole thing with it being like in the sky is amazing. The twists and turns will have your heart pounding. Much better then the first temple run :D	4
4087132	That's what my obit will read if I don't stop playing this game! I'm a new casualty -- er -- I mean fan. But this really gets my heart pumpin' though! Pounding, actually! I'm new to Temple Run and never played the first one. So as a new fan, I have to say, I'm hooked! And I'm still trying to figure out if that's a good thing. This thing REALLY gets my anxiety going, and my heart racing! That ugly monster is right on my heels and trying to eat me alive!!!! OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!! The controls work nicely and are quite responsive -- I didn't get eaten once because they failed me -- just because I kept screwing up! But dang, it's fun! I tried Panda Run awhile back, just cuz I love pandas, and it was clearly an unplayable knockoff by comparison. This one is highly refined. The 3D graphics are excellent. Landscapes are beautifully done. Game play is smooth, crisp and fast paced.<br /><br />It's like being Indiana Jones; swinging, jumping, sliding... RUNNING... and in my case... getting EATEN by that evil monster.... a lot! So what if I stole his idol!?! WTF dude! Is that really justification to keep munching on me and pickin' your teeth with my bones!?!? Duuuude!!?? I'm not nearly good enough at this to speak to how the game progresses. And I never played the first one, so I can't make any meaningful comparisons. But I can say, as a new victim -- er -- I mean, player, this game stands up on its own. No diff if you've played before or not -- this one is fun! I think I'll definitely burn calories and get a cardio workout playing this one, cuz my heart rate spikes and stays there until I stop playing! This things gonna give me grey hairs, or even kill me! Pump up my oxygen hubby (literally) cuz I gotta play Temple Run again! Is this thing doctor approved?!?! Hope I don't end up a headline -- disabled man dies playing Temple Run2. How's that for PR. For sure game downloads would spike with that one. Play it if you dare!	5
4093104	O_o I guess I am the first to review.  When I read the description, I got really excited because I need help with organizing and planning. Then I downloaded it and began to put in my next test. There was an error.  I restyled everything and there still was an error.  WTF.  A little disappointed. I really liked the layout too. Hopefully it works for others.	1
4099474	I can't believe how they try to scan you on spending money on a free game, up to a hundred bucks....this game is addicting yes but I will not spend a dime on fake money and second acorns. I hate this game but I love it....for explain its cool to build your own land but each time you buy land it goes up 100,000, 2000,000, 3000,000 until you get to a million then boom straight to ten million after the mil!!!!! Wtf? And it does glitches out here and there but not a lot and all you have to do is pres that black tab to the right and press the house to get out	3
4099989	2% downloaded in 10 mins...Wtf??? I haven't played yet still downloading. ill get back to u on the game.. lets hope its worth it	2

I subscribed to Newsweek for decades.  No more.<br /><br />Time Magazine knows how to do it right.

4102676	I like this app. But it has a MAJOR problem. I try to play a song and then it just says, MUSIC DOWNLOAD HAS STOPPED, and I'm like WTF! and it takes like 5-20 tries to get the song playin. Like when I try to play, DON'T MINE AT NIGHT,  it would say that.	4

4111387	It says that it is a free app,but all I got after givingmy email,name and age was a charge for $4.99. WTF?	1
4111769	I like this game. It good, honest. But... it can be boring. Same as the free one. No updates. The knives SUCK CHEESE! But CHEESE is awesome so bad example. This is a great way to occupy myself and others with the multiyplayer mode. Which BTW DOESN'T WORK! when I tried multiplayer mode it first crashed, then detected 2 fingers at once, after that it showed.... A FREAKING POP UP ADD! WTF? IT SUCKS! DON'T GET! SAVE YOUR MONEY! HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND! thanx 4 reading my comment. And remember don't buy. *blows kisses* BYE!	4

4123146	This should really be higher up on the search results! Why the he11 didn't Amazon just include a freaking camera app on this thing?? Luckily, some kind soul just took the latest camera app from google and made it available for our kindle fire, FOR FREE! The little intro screen before you can actually use the camera is severely annoying, but what you gonna do? Amazon effed up and this is free! Thanks!!<br /><br />Seriously, wtf Amazon?	5
4127960	this wont download... wtf?!?! really man<br />I really wanted to play this app too! it says it has an &quot;error&quot; but it wont fix or help me fix it.	1
4128759	I own a 1.4 GHz quad core tablet with 2 GBs of RAM and yet, this app is incompatible with it! WTF?! Why can't I be the judge of that? According to Google Play, there are several apps that are incompatible with my tablet, but if I can find it in Amazon's app store, I can usually download and install it and it works just fine.<br /><br />This app, I can't even find in the Amazon app store. So even Amazon deems it so incompatible that I can't even download it from them. What's it going to do, blow up my tablet? Keep your damn app!	1
4129954	don't get this app. it continuously said I needed to delete stuff sso I could play it. NOW ALL MY APPS AND MUSIC IS GONE. IM SO PISSED PLEASE FIX THIS. and it still says I need to delete stuff. THERES NOTHING &quot;LEFT&quot; TO UNISTALL. WTF?!!!	1

4137696	In the beginning I thought this game was interesting enough.  You get a taste of the hunting challenge while sitting safely on a sofa in a warm room with a cup of tea, cheese and crackers within arms reach.<br /><br />What I don't get is how the game wants to sell me stuff.  In the real world I got the weapons/guns and gear I need for hunting bad guys, varmints and food.  What's up with the buy this and buy that or you can't move on in this game?  How are these purchases made anyway; do I need to have my credit card out to play?  WTF?<br /><br />I think this will be another game I delete.	2

4197427	i found it very hard to control my vehicle in lunar racer. and it was kind of hard to see my car because it blended in with the white background. so i spent all my coinage &quot;upgrading&quot; to a second color, which i didn't even get to chose (i wanted purple but they gave me puke-blue.) then i tried to play the game again, hoping i'd do better once i could see my car. but at that point i got locked out of the game because i didn't have the stars or the coins or whatever i needed to &quot;upgrade&quot; to a space station or the moon or anyplace. i presume there must be a way to buy my way in, but i refuse to pay money for a &quot;free&quot; game. maybe i might shell out for a pro version of this if there was one, except for... MISSLES?!! wtf, are you kidding me? you have to not only drive fast and well but also MURDER your opponent and risk getting murdered yourself? this is supposed to be ok for kids! why do we have to murder people in a racing game?	1

4208784	I have to start by saying,  I really love the developer Gameloft.  I like their games so much that when i received a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas I went to the app store and bought my favorite games.  I was really excited to play Order and Chaos on my Kindle Fire HD so I downloaded it and was disappointed how far behind the version is on the HD compared to iOS.  I figured I would just try it out until Gameloft catches up with their other versions but when i created my character it said my subscription was up? I just downloaded it 12/25/12 WTF.  I wrote to Gameloft that day and have heard nothing.  So there you have it.  Not only is it outdated on kindle it still requires a subscription and you have to pay again to just play the game.  Really lame and I hope they fix it because it really is great on iOS. Like World of Warcraft in your pocket.  Gameloft please fix you are better than this.	1
4208925	wtf I was able to change the name on my phone but not on my kindle this is ridiculous wtf! !!!! minus two stars	3
4210772	Seriously I mean this is s*** its like wanna plug in my hard drive n s*** I highly advise u don't get this Uk just saving you cuz I mean I'm just like wtf over here	1
4213508	Minecraft pocket edition is a great app. It has almost everything in the origional minecraft does, but there are some things missing, like Enderman, villagers, armor( I mean, come on!), dispencers, emeralds, enchantment tables, skins, levers, and pressure plates. Zombies drop feathers instead of rotten flesh(WTF???). There is redstone, but you can't do anything with it. That's just the tip of the iceberg. I hope they will have an update soon encompassing all of these things, but until then I don't think this app deserves the full five stars.	4
4215179	Bought & paid for his on my Kindle Fire HD. Its NOT showing up on my Kindle, it`s NOT in my Cloud either. NO options to help me download this or anything. $3 down the drain, WTF?	1

4229723	My 2 yo old loves the songs however in the last 2-3 months this company has been updating all its apps and the updates are SCARY. Nursery Rhymes #1 keep putting shortcuts to online gambling on my screen. This is intolerable and it was deleted.<br /><br />RIGHT NOW. One of the Nursery Rhyme apps is asking to update and under &#34;services that cost you money&#34; its asking for permission to &#34;make phone calls without your consent&#34;<br /><br />WTF?<br /><br />(I do not allow my apps to &#34;automatically update&#34;	2
4232430	This app is chock full of bugs. Makes my smartphone freeze. Tried to unlock the models by paying 99 cents. The models remain locked. Wtf?	1
4237881	ok the idea of HBO GO is awesome im not complaining about the free service.  but the kindle app sucks at times.  sometimes it wont load and when i want to stop watching i hit the close screen and i will got to put it away when it rotates (with the screen off) it starts playing again wtf. i contacted hbo and they had me do the typical resets delete and reinstall.  but still didnt work recontacted them and they ignored me after that	2
4237973	This game is good for when your stuck waiting in a parking lot. It's okay. Some logos they add too many clues and others you're like wtf?	3

4240052	man, this game is awesome, my sister has it and i have been trying to get money to buy it and it rocks as hard as diamond sword, but i wish in creative you had a flint and steel to light TNT to blow up, i mean really, i spent time building a gigantic tower 100 blocks high and i find out that you cant light it on fire!!! that might be the only bad thing but i wish they had mods for the pocket edition, i saw a bunch of YouTube of the left for dead 2 mod and i waste my money on that stupid mods elite, i mean wtf, what is wrong with that. but maybe i am speaking like it sucks, but hey, i am just warning you that the TNT on creative is unable to be triggered so amazon, if you are reading this complain to those Minecraft people that TNT wont blow in creative, also the creepers are really starting to get on my nerves they can suicide bomb me? i knew that but you should really lower the population on the creepers, and dont tell me to play on peaceful i am not a peaceful N00B! make TNT blow up in creative and lower the population of creepers so if you don't like mobs play on peaceful, you will find it in the options you N00BS.<br />so there you have it, people, if you like to blow stuff up or not have your stuff blown up, then this is not the app for you, becuase those creepers will keep in owning you!	4
4243990	i love reddit. working at a tattoo shop we get easily bored. not anymore with reddit. wtf-best one. using the web browser is terrible with the tablet , this makes it soo much easier. hit the logo to choose the catagory btw. . . took me while to  figure that out	5
4245141	well, when I first got this it worked great. I had several locations set up and it looked good. there must have been an update that screwdriver something up because now I can only seem to use it for my city somehow (Pittsburgh) while before I had several local areas and a few cities in different States. wtf?? if it worked how it did when I first downloaded it several months ago it would get a full five stars.	3
4246107	This game has way to many glitches... Always having to force close always having to wait... Don't like the fact that EVERYTHING costs too much money... then they put different prices on the same items you need to remove for example.... A Timberwood tree that needs removel costs $1,500 while the same tree next to it also Timberwood costs $15,000... WTF is up with that....<br /><br />Just to many issues.... Will not recommand...	1
4249543	really. 99 fricken cents make it free because this app ain't worth no doller like what the h w  hockey stick is going on here like really people your letting this company get a measley buck out of u like wtf is wrong with you for buying this my opinion bye it if you want its gonna be your fault for wasting cash and giving this stupid company money for there stupid invention. screw the people who made this and bye. ;) lol	1

4261720	After downloading, when starting the app it tells you a 58 mb download of media is required to continue. When I press ok is says download stopped due to unexpected http status code 404. Tried several times. Reinstalled the app and tried again. No dice. It's a piece of crAPP. Like the vast majority of them. It's a crAPP shoot everytime you buy an app these days. WTF.	1
4262376	the dev is topFREEgames but its 99&cent; wtf ill buy when price goes down it was the same with bikerace just proves amazon is out to rip us off on apps	2

4277354	sometimes it really pisses me off....it ask for MODERN ITEMS OLD PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME USING.<br />Well I named modern items got them all wrong, it wanted VCR and hearing aid...wtf. Sometimes words don't interchange, I said cop or police and it wanted police officer. Can be very annoying, luckily I got it for free	3
4278215	As people have already stated facebook is needed here....but not to play the game- just to complete fast money round. Also the AI is really bad...you have to be almost exact to get the answer...even then its iffy...many cases it puts in something you never even typed....one fast money round I typed in dog...computer put cat...wtf? really? overall it is a fun game...but you get what you pay for here........remember its a free ap.	3

Wtf I payed $0.99 for this app &amp; I couldv'e spent it on Angry Birds Add Free. Keep your money &amp; don't spend it on this thieving app.	1
4290348	So I have this game on my ipod and I love playing it. It's so much fun! On my ipod it is free..... but on kindel its not..... for the same version one is free and one u pay...?!?!?!?! WTF ?!?!?!?	1
4290463	I kicked ass at this game when I first got my Kindle. Had the fishbone sword and a few doors to open, that I knew of. Pissed now that I cannot get anywhere. Stops after a few levels. WTF!? Want the whole game again and don't want to hear it is a fault on my side. Sad.	2
4292683	I originally liked this game but when I tried different modes of gameplay your cutoff from playing saying your free trial (30 or so seconds into it) is over and you need to purchase, all I have to say is WTF, Ta-Dah Apps, you just lost a customer for life. seems like you used the trial app but put the paid app price glad it was the FAOTD.	1
4294624	You won't get the full paid version. It's a paid trial version. during the game, half way through a puzzle, I get the message ' trial over' and am given the option to buy the full version. WTF. Shame on Amazon and double shame on Ta-Dah Apps. A developer whom I shall avoid like the plague.	2
4297975	okay so I am in my room and I wanna go do stairs,  so I try and turn my light on it doesn't work.. had Mg kindle and went to get a flashlight app,  I get this one and it  don't even work?!? wtf bro!	1

4310101	I liked this product on my old Kindle.  Unfortunately I gave that Kindle to my parents when I got the new Kindle 8.9 - the new more expensive Kindle does not allow this app to run - WTF?<br /><br />12/22/2012 update - just downloaded to 8.9 and seems to work fine, will try it for tonight's games.  Thanks for the quick fix Amazon and the NBA!<br /><br />12/23/2012 update - I love this app, extremely easy and intuitive to use and the video on the 8.9 is better and the internet faster than on the original Kindle.  Great work NBA!  The one improvement would be to have radio feeds available from the app and not just video for League Pass members.  Sometimes I just want the call from the local team or can only listen.<br /><br />Can I now give it 6 stars?	5
4310290	Why does ALL Angry Bird platforms, including this one, CONSTANTLY force close and restart?  Whenever an ad tries to pop up, it forces the game to restart.  For a company like Rovio, which has their brand EVRYWHERE (and tons of money)...you would think they would prevent s*** like this from happening.  Get your R&D team to this.  WTF?	1

4313781	Doesn't deserve 1star but it's the lowest  lucky it was free but still wtf does root have to do with a game here?	1
4317098	Caution, this app can give you a headache! It is very confusing to play. You have to get a blue choo-choo to a red station, and a red choo-choo to a blue station... It doesn't work though, it won't let you put the blue choo choo in the red station! WTF AMAZON! We just reelected Obama, our IQ's aren't high enough to play games like this... Please give us a preschool number app or a city/world building app were socialism and high taxes won't cause you to loose! Thanks, sincerely,  wtf...	1
4317261	MORE GAMEPLAY UPDATES NEEDED! this game has great potential, the only thing you can do in this pocket version is dig and build buildings. the crafting table can be put in game but you cant craft anything...WTF is up with that. as of now this game is NOT worth the $$.	2
4318877	I love this game. I was actually making great progress and enjoying playing when I started noticing that pictures and words on the game screen were appearing overlaped. Shortly after my kindle crashed (during game play) and will not come back on. Only the green light flashes. Wtf.	1

I can't think of a single reason why this app would need access to gps wifi or billing info not even downloading this one but have to give it a one star because of the permissions......	1
4329403	its not in English... wtf!! if there was a way to tell what language it was in or maybe I just should have looked at the app first! or maybe there could b an English version Cu's it looks like some good recipes :(	2

4346820	"I've been skeptical of how hypnosis works. I always wanted to see if it would work on a family member to make her stop gambling. So I decided to give this a try to find out. I picked the Awaken Psychic ability hypnosis because it seemed like an interesting thing to start with.<br /><br />During the first session I was awake throughout the whole process and was aware of my surroundings. Then I felt this pressure between my eyes, slightly above my brow line and the longer the session kept going on, the more pressure I felt. I was thinking \\""WTF is going on here?\\"". After the session I had to Google what I experienced and come to find out it was my 3rd eye opening. The 3rd eye is the extra perception you get from being psychically awakened.<br /><br />As of now, every time I hear this audio tape I always fall asleep throughout the whole session. This session runs about an hour, but when I wake up I feel like I had a great power nap. No matter how hard I try to stay awake and aware during these sessions, I always find myself snoring for some reason.<br /><br />Does it work? Yes it does.<br /><br />Does it make you psychic? It makes me more of an Empath than anything else."	5
4349447	DarkChaos here and why the hell isn't the chat being fixed? its been like 2 weeks now wtf is up with the chat not working? common dev's get on it and fix the damn thing. that aside...good game I would actually give it 4.5 stars. but this crape needs to be fixed.<br />(signed) DarkChaos.	1

4361071	Permissions look okay, but but WTF?! After scanning with lookout and named safe, I installed it. Before I even opened the app I started getting pop ups at the bottom of my screen. Never had ANY pop ups until this crap. Instantly unistalled without even trying the app. @ developer: Care to explain? Not very pleased. First time ever for pop ups and I have had my phone for 4 months with about 50 - 60 apps. Good luck folks	1
4364003	I would give it 5 stars if it would lower the cost for money and gold. I have billions of gold and money. it is freaking 99$ for 532000 fake dollars. I have a million 327 from only three months of saving up. Wtf!!!!! If it costs 100$ for that when u can earn way more,  what's the freaking point. Theses r retarded people. The game is okay but this matter is plain horrible.	3

4389762	IF THEY WANT SOMEONE TO BUY THIS, THEY SHOULD FIX IT TO TILT STEERING OR MAYBE DELETE IT. TOTAL WASTE OF MY FREE TIME AND KINLDE MEMORY.  I SUPPOSE IT WOULD SUCK EVEN MORE ON AN I-POD OR SMALLER PHONE. ALSO, YOU HAVE TO *AHEM* BUY THE FULL VERSION WICH IS THE SAME EXCEPT YOU HAVE MORE CHARCTERS AND THERE IS A MULTIPLAYER OPTION.  I CAN NOT,&Ntilde;OT BELIEVE I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS GAME...............  WTF TO NAMCO.  YOU CAN DO BETTER.  WAIT,YOU CANT	1

4398524	I just wanna. play the game....reallyy!!_  can I just play the game ywithout aany reviews....wtf do u want me to say	5
4400081	Omb! I am in love with this game! NOT!!!! This game gets SOOOOOO BOOOORING after like the first two levels! WTF? This is really what everyone was &quot;so excited&quot; about? Well I don't know what they see in this game. Its so boring.	1
4402745	this game is like soo stupid. I mean wtf is this stuf? is it supposed to be minecraft? what a ripoff! dont waste ur money on this app!	1
4404483	no parenthesis? wtf i need that for my stuff and other various calculations. i dont want to find it on a graph everytime. thats weak.	1
4404925	This game is very laid back and fun.  Here are a few things to consider about this app.<br />-There are iap! Generally, I don't care for them, but they are not necessary at all to compete/play.  Zynga not only states that they are in the game, but instructs users how to prevent children from accidently pur hasing them (good work).<br />-There are ads.  Despite being annoying, they are to be expected with a free app.  Furthermore, users may pay to remove them.<br />-The in-game dictionary is EXTENSIVE.  Some users mays see this as a pro, but I would argue that it leads to too many people forming obscure/antiquared words simply by arranging letters until something &quot;sticks&quot;.  I already resigned from a game because someone used &quot;zikurat&quot; (wtf).  I feel that this style of play is against the spirit of the game.  To avoid this, it's best to play someone you know and have a gentleman's agreement.	4
4405416	"I requested this game from Amazon awhile ago now. While attempting to download it, I was very dissapointed to see a prompt pop-up telling me,<br />\\""This file is too large to download over the U.S Cellular Network. Please try again when you have access to a Wi-Fi connection.\\"" WTF?!?! Doesn't USC claim to be one of, if not THE largest cellular network out there?<br />Am I seriously supposed to believe that I can't download a friggin' VIDEO GAME(!) w/a (very expensive) Dual-Core Pentium Processor powered smartphone? Now, that seems just about as rediculous as as it does dissapointing. We do not have Wi-Fi in our home, & have very limited access to it locally here. So, the other day, we were visiting a local cafe/bicycle shop that offers free Wi-Fi access. Sadly, I was met w/even GREATER disappointment after attempting to DL the game over their network. After a (minimum) 35-40 min. wait, watching the 'progress bar' make it to approx. 1/4 of the way to completion, we eventually had to leave the cafe to keep a previous commitment elsewhere. What the hell type of network/equipment does it take to download this frickin' game?<br />I'm not a big 'gamer' these days anyhow, but I've decided to 'quit while I'm behind'. I've given up trying to DL games. Frankly, I just don't want to devote (waste) another minute of my life waiting for seemingly inevitable disappointment.<br />Hey, does anybody know if I can be reimbursed for the hr. (or so) of my life that I'll never get back?<br />Plus, now I've got to spend god-knows-how-long figuring out how to get this worthless file deleted off of my phone. Thanks for nothing."	1
4406799	Wtf is going on with this? I cant download anything anymore! When I try to &quot;download as MP3&quot; It says &quot;Searching&quot; and then a half second later it stops! I even deleted a song I had already downloaded from this app, and tried to re-dowload the same song and its not working! Wtf... you lose 4 stars..	1
4406905	the guy who created this app has no idea how to make an app.he just makes a scam with each app he makes.WTF IS WRONG WITH THE CREATOR!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?'?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!	1
4407969	it worked great but there was an update and it wont play videos anymore wtf happened it was like it became shit all the other downloaders are shit and aren't as User friendly.	5
4409145	pay real money for a game so you can pay real money in game. WTF is wrong with this company	1
4409663	it wont even let me delete it off my kindle fire well it kinda is but I keep seeing it and all it says is app is unavailable at the moment like WTF! don't download its a horrible piece of shit app for the kindle fire	1
4409814	used to work just fine...after a few &quot;upgrades&quot; nothing works...can't download videos/mp3s...can't even how the videos....wtf?! really upsetting because I used to love this app.	2
4411274	Won't download!!!! WTF?! Seriously? Worked great when I first got it but now it sucks and won't download ANYTHING! Soooooo angry! Had a blast when I first had it but it is a total waste of time and effort. Complete and utter bullsh!t.	1
4412254	I have been using this app for about 2 years with no problems, until early August this year. Priblems started after update in August. I managed to get it working again with the help of the Verizon employees that time, but this time they are stumped.<br />What the hell are you doing Audible? I am in the middle of a book and can't access it!  WTF.	3
4412995	I don't work for the dev &amp; this is a great word game!  You just need half a brain to play it &amp; if it's too difficult for you, uninstall it!  Excellent choice for FAOTD-if you got it free, wtf are you complaining for?	5
4413450	its good but it glitches<br />and when u thinking u are buying somethings for your character it will take u yo Amazons website. wtf?	4
4414307	it is a good game. I feel it needs more action and maybe better rewards for completing princess tasks I have 3 stupid masks and nothing else WTF.....Lol give it a 4 .	4
4419403	it said update needed and erased all my stuff WTF bitches did it on purpose I hats them don't buy this app	1
4419571	on your phone or on your i-whatever, instagram (the real one) is free and you can upload pics. on this app, you cant upload pics, and its $2.99 more than instagram! WTF?!?!?!?!?	1
4420648	There is no dummy defense in this app! I thought it would save us all from the democrats, but it doesn't, I took it too the dnc and everybody still spoke, everyone else still got brainwashed, so WTF! Please update to get rid of the libs, thanks!	1
4421415	Well wtf? I downloaded a video and cant actually watch the video unless I am connected to a wifi network...like cant you make an app that saves the video to my DEVICE?	2
4427049	I'm a big fan of stand up. I've always enjoyed hearing about the creative process and the stories of what got<br />certain people to arrive at the current point in their lives.<br />I've never listened to Marons stand up but by his own description he seems to improvise a lot of his material. That style serves him extremely well in his interviews,<br />he has the ability to breach some very difficult subjects with candor and compassion but can diffuse the tension of the subject matter with humor that doesn't insult the persons experience. Some of the episodes tend to be deeply revealing in ways that I've heard no one accomplish before, these aren't Barbra Walters softball questions and fluff interviews. There is talk about drug addiction, alcoholism, severe depression even coming out of the closet.<br />There can be honest tension with some of the people being interviewed, maybe from strained relationships in the past that rather than never having the person on his show he makes great shows out of it.<br />Guests aren't just comedians, some people I had never been familiar with directly but have influenced the movies and shows I watch or music I listen to. . Writers, comedic actors artist all very interesting people giving personal insight or talking about things that go on behind the scenes.<br />Hope you give it a chance, I put WTF along side This American Life and Radio Lab as my favorite podcasts. Thanks	5
4428325	This game was a great game when I was able to play it on my S2, I had to reset my phone to factory default and after that, it was no longer compatible with my devise wtf!	1
4431945	That being said. Worst game ever. Why?<br /><br />First: huge Ass download in order to play. 430MB. Tried downloading. It failed, somehow the game started still. Don't know, don't care.<br /><br />Second: Beat the tutorial. Controls are crap. I cant manage to not switch guns when I don't want too. I learned you can turn on a 'tap to shoot' which made it about 1% better. Still crap.<br /><br />Third: First reccommended weapon costs 5000 game currency. You don't have enough. I play the mission, get like 100. Still need like 3000 more to get the cheapest non tutorial weapon. WTF?<br /><br />Four: Where are the missions? Oh right, every level up you unlock a new main mission but otherwise you have to spam the survival mode in order to get enough money to buy a better weapon just to beat a mission where you're in a helicopter. Dumb. Or I suppose you could buy glu credits.<br /><br />Five: Heavy heavy ridiculously heavy pressure to buy credits. The games just too damned slow otherwise. I played an hour, and still don't have enough for the first cheapest non tutorial weapon. PS: if you have credits on your glu account, prepare to buy more, cause it doesn't synch.<br /><br />Overall score? The out of game play art is nice. That's my only compliment. Game sucks. Needs major improvements. That or my copy is messed up because of that download issue and I don't have access to the full game. Idk. I reccommend you not waste time on this game. Thistle game is horrible, avenue compared to glue standards. 0/5, no stars, 0 out of 100	1
4432368	wow, I would say wtf must be 12 or still drunk from last nights Nascar race....<br />I would say this is not for him based on all the horrid typos and crappy autocorrects.<br /><br />This game is ok for not having any permissions listed, but it is not my thing.	3
4433259	everytime I try to play it keeps shutting down. wtf keeps up I will delete it. fix it please cuz this sucks....	1
4435558	too many ppl. they cant c my age and they know I'm under aged but come anyway and want, what? SEX! wtf! I'm done with these perverts.	2
4436573	I loved this game but then the update came and deleted all of my data wtf??? I was halve way done but the I get the update and boom all of my stuff is gone please help.	2
4436650	single player mode was the ONLY reason I purchased this.  WTF happened????????? why would they remove one of the best features?  Makes no sense.  I am really disappointed!  It sucks that I have to wait for a random person to play now.  I have been waiting 23 days for someone else to make a play and now I can't even play the computer while waiting....  :-(	1
4437115	I played on friends kindle an wached th move but where Zeus an adom???!!! I mes. wtf it not real dudes.	4
4437454	I paid $2.99 for this app because it brags about having AI single player option in its description. Now its gone. Wtf? I didn't expect to be scanned by EA or Scrabble.	2
4438960	Yes, commercials. Not ads, but full blown, full length adverts for beer, cars and burgers.<br /><br />This game cheats and cheats in the worst way. You die when you shouldn't, even after making all the right moves and jumps you'll still mysteriously lose a life for no apparent reason or the game will start to lag so bad no matter what you do, your jumps will still register a second or two behind a finger tap causing you to die.<br /><br />This is no accident mind you and the most maddening thing about it all is that the game is designed that way in order to force you to watch more commercials. It's rigged because every few plays you have to sit through a 16 to 30 second ad for something, generally the same ones, over and over again.  Now I can't even drive by a Jack in the Box without getting irritated.<br /><br />Also, if you're a more conservative parent, you'll quickly realize that some of the ads aren't suitable for children. I let my nephew play this on my Kindle the other day and was displeased when he came to ask me what a Corona was. I mean WTF?	2
4440274	3 stars on almost every level and post-update I have to start over?!?!? WTF!!!! I thought this was an oversight the first update and would be corrected this time. NOPE!  The worst update ever!	1
4440892	Yes, wtf is right. The Army has learned that the USMC is ....let's say... &quot;slow&quot; enough to make very good bullet catchers.	3
4441215	It had a better variety than Crunchyroll, but when I clicked on an episode of Fairy Tail, it wouldn't work!!!! WTF!!!! @3@	1
4441612	isn't working on my kindle?  hummed.. glad it was free! ................ I really wanted to play it too. hummed fix it..<br />I have to write 20words to submit this??? wtf?	2
4442548	It's a fun game but I wish Ynez free versiion came first cause I already paid for it. :-( All I have tow say is WTF!!!	3

4444586	was over level 35, updated and it reset to new game WTF glu. this sucks why the hell did you guys do that...will never pay/play another one of your games	1
4445461	Some levels are really hard. The game has clues, however some of the clues are difficult and because of this I feel like it's not a clue. Download the guide because there will be times when it is a WTF moment and yell &quot;how was that a clue?&quot; This game is challenging and I hats the fact that I have to look at the guide for guidence. I'm not asking for making this game easy, but to make the clues a little better.	3
4448475	I have the samsung nexus.  it did what it said and found the cover art in the app.  however in my music player on the phone it still shows nothing but Easter colors.  Wtf?!	3
4450899	When I first saw that this game featured vampires, I thought it would be an amazing experience. Getting to play as a super strong, super fast, immortal bloodsucker... where could this book go wrong? I'll tell you where; stupid politics. The story takes up most of your time talking about the civil war. there's no action, just politics. You don't get to hunt for prey, or terrorize the people as any real vampire would be prone to doing. instead you get stuck reading POLITICS. And the final scene ends with you quaking in fear as you watch a bunch of kkk lynchers string someone up. Wtf?  There was no part of this book that I enjoyed.	2
4452201	This ap is bad; it was advertised as an IQ and aptitude test but only math?  WTF don't waste your time.	1
4453927	It sucks and I had to buy the thing and its a free app wtf so don't get it. trust me	1
4454065	Its a good game but i have a kindle fire and it freezes like WTF!!  but other than that its super fun. (:	3
4454706	I bought angry birds space and loved it... until the most recent upgrade. The upgrade added some features but took away the danger zone level. But don't worry--you can have access to it for an additional 99&cent;. WTF? No thank you.	2
4455970	Updates, three of them, wiped out all previous data, removed levels already completed, asked to pay again for the levels it removed, then removed them all together, wtf?	1
4456263	I searched eminem and this came up wtf eminem is rap well except when he sold out with recovery and not afraid	1
4457958	OMFG I love it but I agree when I try to jump it doent then I die I'm like,&quot; wtf just happened?!?!?!?&quot;	5
4458176	why do you charge people for a game, then while playing the game, you require people to pay more money, wtf is that all about really	1
4459460	"I bought this to drown out early morning traffic that wakes me up at 5:00am. Unfortuanatly the app turns itself off.the \\""the turn of after 30 min.\\"" Feature does not work inaddition to the fact that it is a poorly designed setting. Turn off after 30 / off = on all the time? Turn off after 30 / on= off in 30? Wtf."	3
4460205	Got sucked into the game. Was fun got all the crystals now its going around the board again. There doesn't seem to be a finish line.....wtf!?	3
4460390	wow okay so I loved this app because whenever I need to score a lot of points to catch up it was there.notice I said loved.as a 14 year old I don't think this app does everything it says it does.first of all it doesn't always save the letters I type in.and my biggest concern is that NOT ALL OF THE WORDS ARE ACCEPTABLE!!!wtf that's dumb.right when I think I have the best word with triple scoring I found out its not accepted. gee thanks	2
4464204	This would be a pretty good game if it wherent for the fact that it blue screens. He names of tue dragons make u say &quot;WTF? Was Teamlava even thinking?&quot; But truth be told this is just like any other farmvile type game out there, it sucks. Sry Teamlava, this is the wprst app youve come out with yet.	2
4464767	Just like everyone else, I updated and list all my progress which was 3 stars on all levels. But it was ok because now I had the eagle and the egg levels like my wives iPad. However, it had another update (which I stupidly downloaded) and it again lost all my progress and reverted me back to my original starting point of no eagles, no egg levels, and even no new levels. WTF? This is bulls#&amp;$.	1
4466215	ok I was trying to watch a video and it was all sorry this video is unavalible and I was all wtf ..	2
4467618	This app is great. But it lagged so I had to turn the kindle off. I turned it back on the scores/coins were gone! WTF.	4

I do not have any of the installation or usage problems mentioned in many of the 1 star reviews.  App, Widget, WTF?  Installed just like every other App I've put on this in the last 9 months. Well worth the dollar.	5

4511683	wtf: you're not funny and you failed miserably. Commando pete's review was funny. Yours was stupid and made you look like you were 16. I might try the game sometime in the future; it looks ok. 5 stars to offset reviews like wtf's, superman's and that guy who just said crap a lot.	5
4514117	I'm sory I did listen 2 the reviews warnings.

4514949	this is a very good app for cooking. I reccomend it to other people who cook. And to the guy called wtf we dont want to know about your problems and you are a bad person	5
4517806	Awesome app, really works. Should have the option to change between male/female robot voice. Knocked off a star for the huge gay porn add that popped up. wtf!	4
4518041	Well, I wouldn't consider this a fake ....but the likely possibility is that they just have random dots appearing and design it like a real ghost radar and have random common words appearing. I just downloaded it and when I opened my app, it was like &quot;pot &quot; and on the right side of me there was a flower pot. I thought it was cool, but come on, there are pots everywhere! either in your yard or somewhere else, you can always find something common with the random word that appears on the radar. Its a cool app, but in my opinion, they just choose a buncha random words that make you think this app can &quot;detect &quot; stuff when your fooling yourself out. I was using it this morning on my bed and it was like &quot;can, winter, principal &quot;?! Wtf, am I in school or something? lol but this app is worth the download even though it might be fake.	3
4519807	"As soon as I read the Product description of this app, I was compelled to download it immediately.  Not because I had any interest in the game itself, but because I felt the need to exclaim \\""WTF?\\"" when I read the 'plot'.  One day, some developer was sitting at his desk, when he had a great idea:<br /><br />\\""What if humans went extinct and dinosaurs took over the world again.\\""  I'll admit, I'm intrigued by the story possibilities.<br /><br />\\""And of course because their society would be built on the remains of ours, over time they would become even more technologically advanced than humans ever were.\\""  Okay, I'll give them that one. Let's see where this goes.<br /><br />\\""But wait, suddenly their population is threatened by inbreeding, because cousins and siblings can't deny their attraction for one another.\\""  Wait... what?<br /><br />\\""So instead of finding other dinosaurs to which they are not related to for mating, they build a time machine to go back to the prehistoric ages to steal dinosaur eggs.\\"" Not exactly the choice I would have made, but at least their trying to make it more intriguing by adding time travel. You would think that by stealing the eggs of their ancient ancestors, they would in a way causing their own extinction, but let's just go with it.<br /><br />\\""But then, as soon as they get back with the stolen eggs, rival alien factions who are also coincidentally dinosaurs decide that they want the Earth for themselves, and so they steal the eggs from the good dinosaurs who just stole them from their ancestors, and hide them on different planets!\\"" ...WTF?<br /><br />\\""Oh, I got it!  They end up leaving one egg behind and as soon as that egg hatches, rather than picking an older, more intelligent, more experienced dinosaur to go after the twice stolen eggs, the new-born ancestor dinosaur (who is not a descendant of the intelligent species living in the future) is given a weapon pack and forced on a mission to retrieve his siblings who are still trapped inside their eggs.\\"" ..........

4524028	this is an awesome game however i cannot open it for some reason when the advertisment pops up when i open the game if i click the x ok then it closes the app and brings me back to the home screen on my kindle..wtf someone help??	1
4524118	"Half a** Zuma clone, -2 stars.<br /><br />IAP for a \\""premium\\"" version, if you can finish the game without the IAP -1 star, if not, -2 stars.<br /><br />Supports Openfeint, a known data mining tool, -1 star if you can ignore it, -2 if it's required (I've only seen a couple of these).<br /><br />Installs Airpush, haha, WHAT?! This is the app that can't be removed unless you remove the offending app that installed it. Trust me, you WILL be downloading a tool to find this out cause the 1st time you get an ad as a notification thinking your friends/family are texting you, you're going to wonder \\""WTF? An ad in my bar?\\"" The 20th time you're going to be saying \\""Please God, does anyone know how to get this annoying crap off my phone?!\\"" = instant no star review.<br /><br />Adding all this dbaggery up on a \\""paid\\"" version? Title of review. I'll usually forgive an app having IAP or OpenFeint but will knock a star off for it unless it's a shining example of a game such as Six Guns that DESERVES your IAP for getting a real game for free, but to have both plus friggin AirPush? How much sh** can you stack up before you admit a game needs a negative star rating or at least a zero star option to warn people that this developer is attempting to abuse you and your phone? This isn't about not appreciating something that's free, it's about protecting people from vultures that are trying to scam the innocent."	1
4525729	forget this game (ha ha its memory).  I want to know where superman75 and wtf are. I miss you guys.  your the reason I read these crappy reviews.  waaaaa waaaaa	3

4542850	I hate the fact that its an online game and only 4 of the characters help out in the village. It takes too long to complete some of the tasks not to mention that you don't recover axes daily or after a certain amount of time. WTF? You cant cut the forest down with no axes!!! You shouldnt have to pay or sign up for crap you dont want just to chop at the forest.	3
4543978	This is a phenomenal game. Great fun and doesnt deviate from the classic game. I love playing it and it was working great but after about a week now it freezes after the loading screen and I cant play the games. WTF?! Please fix!	3
4544745	First of, I am not the developer and in no way associated with the developer of this app, but I am a developer myself for other Android apps. I downloaded this app just like any other FAOTD, and happy to see a real app instead of useless games every day.<br /><br />I just noticed some of the reviewers are leaving bad feedback for this app because apparently its only a widget. While I think the UI of this app may use some improvement, I think it is a fine UI as an app - you do need to explore a bit to find all the features so its not super intuitive. But you do not need to use it as a widget to take advantages of it - I am not using it as a widget and I can enter all information, view charts (well you need at least data points to view a chart), set goals, calculate BMI and even BFP without ever leaving the app.<br /><br />Please explore the app a bit before leaving 1 star reviews - if you do not like the UI, feel free to suggest improvements to developers. Believe me or not, we developers are also human beings and we have feelings, and we are also trying to make a living by selling apps. If you don't like the app, delete it and be done with it. As for myself, I have not consented to make my app a FAOTD and never will, I think many developers like me feel this way because we do not like being trashed by freeloaders who download an app for free and think it is worthless even though they got it for free anyway. It is because of inconsiderate reviewers like you all Amazon users are suffering because there are many great apps that will NEVER be FAOTD as long as people like wtf, superman75 are not permanently banned.<br /><br />Just had to get that off my head.	5
4545031	"Does not run on Velocity Micro Cruz t408. Gives error message that says it won't run on \\""my phone\\"" but is designed to run on a tablet. BIG WTF. Deleted. Moving on to something worthwhile."	1

4561850	Here we go again. This is the forth app that I bought from Amazon that was stated was compatible to my superpad 3 but it doesn't. Downloads but won't install...WTF? Guess I can't trust their compatibility statements. Waste of time and money.	1
4563651	Idk if it's real, but right after i got the app. My sister was painting her nails pink then the app went crazy and said &quot;nails&quot; after a red dot appeared right by her, then faded away. She looked at me and said WTF o_e . Afterwards it started saying random words....	4
4564578	So it told me im bored which im not i have kids so i hardly get a break but i looked at my husbands and it asked what hes doing with me and basically told him to break up with me.

4569253	I am sick and tired of the search option not changing when I select sort by newest users or sort by last login. It still shows the same people everytime. Also, I don't quite get why if you send let's say 50 people a message each, every one of them ignore you. WTF?	2
4571052	I don't think I will ever understand how people can take these stories seriously and then actually worship the jealous, hate-filled, lazy god described in them. You really want to give someone credit, how about humanity! I don't see how those kids who teased a bald man really deserved to be eaten by bears nor do I understand how god could get mad because HE allowed his other creations to mate with mans daughters and then kill all of humanity save for one family.....then insist that that family is to inbreed to populate the earth again. if that seriously happened why are we different races? Cane's decendents are dead now because of the flood....wtf! Anyone who takes this junk seriously needs their head examined!	3
4571628	I played this game for about a week. It was ok until it updated and made me restart from the beginning! WTF!	1
4575119	i dont like that i have to clear data in order to start a new game. ai definitely needs work and randomization needs to be random. the ai's had perfect hands three games in a row...wtf...plus i want to see stats so i know how well or not well i'm doing please...	3
4575491	this app is ok but u crewmen download 2 things ur kf starts to force cloth and then when it says 100 % it force closes and you get back on there it turns red u resume download and it says 10% wtf wtf is this app doing well its for all youtube downloaders except youtune downloader the one that looks like those acting things	1
4576318	great game awesome navigation basic rules and for wtf its sudoku not a cross word if it were a crossword it would say crossword	5
4577249	omg I found out my cousin was an alien!! WTF dude! when I found out my balls dropped right to the floor.  but this really is a cool app.	5
4577364	I will change the rating if/when it gets added &lt;_&lt; I cant believe they don't support this yet wtf. I have a hbo subscription it should offer hbo go	1
4577774	I hate seeing all the bad reviews because a game isn't compatable with someone's device.  Unfortunately, just because its free doesn't mean you have to have it and it doesn't mean that a dev has to make it compatible with everything.  Who.in their right mind frame questions the names of animals?  This is 2012 and in every country people use foreign names so who cares?  As an author, you should've been able to come up with a better complaint but everyone thinks they're an author since the introduction of ebooks since they son't have to prove quality to get the financial support.needed to print books.  You lack complete self control and the ability to present yourself as a decent member of society and a role model with a name as &quot;wtf.&quot;  As to psyllee, get a life.  You sound like nothing more than a disgruntaled ex employee who was fired.  Get over it.  So I am giving this 5 stars to counteract some of the bogus reviews.  This isn't suppose to please an adult so it should be bases on how enjoyable it is for a child.	5
4579897	At first it was great but now it tells me &quot;err&quot; WTF! Cant load anything or play anything! Not worth it ppm hopefully they fix it it was a great app but now it aux!	1

4596142	Good app but in the description it says there is alternate events but there is none. Wtf...false advertising.  Do not buy due to the lack of integrity of the company.	2
4598003	I looked@ this app &amp; thought..maybe this is better than the built in alarm.  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />There is NO reason an alarm clock needs these permissions unless it is robbing you.<br /><br />This is like having an app that tells the criminals when you are not home and where to find the spare key.<br /><br />Better than 90% of the FAOTH have been data miner Apps.  We called this spyware and malware on our computers, how is this different?<br /><br />Ooh, this is android.  That makes it ok....WTF?	1
4598130	Okay first of all wtf does pwnd mean second why do u even need a button like this for? I mean u can jus say it	1

4605627	well if u can get 5 stars on the first level without screaming curse words and wanting to smash ur phone,  ur better than me.. mr experia play gamer.. but whatever.  lag with jumps, hold too long double triple jumps... whatever I cold go on.. random useless characters that don't share the same jumping heights or even close to the same power level. useless characters you wish they didn't put in!?? wtf ever. I hate the game now. can't imagne hating a game more! but like I said u got 5 stars on level 1 without hating it, way to go have fun! grrrr	1
4609682	love this app. its everything ever want to do for touching up photos in GIMP or photoshop but it only takes a minute pending how accurate i want to be. i love applying filters, investing them and drawing them on to some objects. hdr on the face makes for a great portrait shot. i love how pinching will zoom while applying the brush and if you leave one finger on the screen, one can pan around. also, amazing how the brush scales with come... Wtf GIMP &amp; photoshop... catch to picsart!<br /><br />now pics art... add layers and ill Mary you.	5
4613508	Seriously, wtf is with all the reviews talking about God? I REALLY hate to burst all you Bible thumper's bubbles, but I got news for you. Without sex, you would not be here. Yes, your parents had sex and you were born. I know, shocking, right? I guess they will burn in hell for it like the rest of us. Maybe you believe you were an immaculate conception... Nah, you are NOT Jesus. Get over yourselves and quit forcing your stupid damn religion down our throats. If I wanted to see or hear about it, I'd go to one of those fronts for cash you people call a church.	5
4615786	The last time Amazon released a farm animal app I got busted for sheep sodomy! After a couple weeks of sheep lovers anonymous, I am all good now. All I want to do now is make the different species mate with each other! My farm is only a mess because I can't get the pig to mount the horse... WTF!...Please update so I can play God, thanks.	1
4618429	This is a great game other than the fact that you run out of energy after 2-3 hunts also that you need better equipment to shoot with that cost more gold than you can earn. why should you have to spend real cash wtf is that about!?	4
4618520	Has many different ways to customise the way you chat. It doesn't lag too much, as compared with IM+ and it is very easy to navigate around in. However, on the Kindle Fire, there is a smiley face button (WTF?) where the enter key should be, which makes it annoying to submit IMs sometimes.	4
4618529	.99 cents doesn't seem to be enough to buy this game since I cant download it only kindle fire wtf?!?!?	1
4618652	I went to load up this game on my Kindle Fire, and it told me that it wasn't compatible. WTF gameloft.	1
4619484	the game is very fun and actually simulates a real casino slot experience .....lose lose lose....lower your bet cause your almost broke.......win....win....win....with little money bet...the best way to play this game is to link into facebook and get friends to give you...free spins.....etc....except on kindle fire.....it always seems to be updating and wont allow you to send/receive gifts......WTF....VERY DISTURBING ...otherwise very fun until your broke.....and have to wait 4 hours for coins again .....basically angering you into spending real cash for fake cash.....Get It....	4
4620573	it wouldnt even let me download the stupid app! WTF!!!! i mean have had a LOT of stupid apps but atleast they downloaeded!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
4624236	They can't even proof read the description for the game before they make it wtf haha. Not worth the time.	1
4624278	recently got this app. played two games and already getting spam!!! wtf is that about? do not get unless you like spam. game is ok. nothing more I can say about it...	1
4625579	first off this part is for the reviewer Wtf. You'really lame and your reviews aren't funny at all. either stop or get better.<br /><br />the game? its OK but could be way better.	5
4626117	I love the game but after you update it you get bingo but then it goes a way!?!?!? WTF THATS WAY I UPDATED IT THANK. YOU	3
4626143	i like it but theres is no volume in it i like feeling the pop pop i was all like wtf wheres the volume	5
4626720	this game is super addicting and tons of fun except for 2 major drawbacks.<br /><br />1. you cant save your progress i hate getting to 30,000 points just to die and have to start all over again. that really really sucks!<br /><br />Which brings me to number 2. What is up with dying!!! it flashes starving 2 to 3 times while you scurry looking for a school of fish or a scuba diver then it immediately flashes Critical 2 to 3 times and you die! wtf that has caused me to violently shake my phone in the heat of passion haha. It literally takes about 5 seconds and you're dead.<br /><br />All in all i give it a 3 cuz even tho it drives me bonkers i cant stop playing it. I just hope for part 4 they fix that issue or upgrade it.	3
4626887	Great FAOTD! Now work is fun, because it is an app? WTF! What's next, a trash collection app, maybe a weed pulling app, a street corner sign tosser would be great! Then we could all learn what their secret moves are!	1
4628488	no wonder this spit was free when i got it cuz if i paid a penny for this crock of bull ida been pissed. they missing quite a few holidays like CHRISTMAS for example! I really don't get how a calender app could be so off the bucket. no fathers day as well! wtf I mean really? its unfinished apps like this here that show either lack of common knowledge or rushing on the developers behalf. I usually never give 1 star ratings but the fact they tryna charge 99cent for it I had to cuz that gotta be fixed.	1
4631451	what a ripoff with the armour. i thought it comes back every like round but it only lasts 1. like wtf? other than that its ok. but that was just a waste of my glu coins.	3
4632167	This is a cute game my 4 yr old enjoys.<br />It seems like my child is far more mature than &quot;wtf&quot;. So to u I say WTF is wrong with u? I almost feel sorry for u bc it's obvious u have no life &amp; ur excitement is trolling around in cyberspace giving stupid reviews.	5
4633056	Where's the damn update? Google Play Store has had the updated version and doesn't charge extra for the new levels. WTF!?!?	1
4633154	What's the point... To make ur friend THINK ur smarter? Kinda takes the fun out of playing....wtf would rather not play than to cheat, I mean really....	1
4635792	ibplwyed this game every day for like 2 weeks and missed one day. I load it up to discover my timers were reset to 375 hours. Yes 375. wtf. I had been enjoying it	2
4638045	i saw the many good reviews and figured i'd try this app/game (uhh still not sure why it is categorized as a Game).  i like all kinds of quirky and wiiidely various stuff. but ...i guess i thought this was a take care of baby sim?  but not really.  the  &quot;babies&quot; are like cheap plastic dolls that have ZERO movement or animation.  wtf is up?!!  if i were someone who couldn't have a baby and wanted one, this app would be... well, as irrelevant to me as to anyone else wjo plays it. uninstall.	1
4638303	ok wtf all the people that gave bad reveiews are either pacifist or began or vegitarian all you people its called DEER HUNTER RELODED what do you expect rainbows and gumdrops?	5
4639435	Ok all the jokes are good besides the Soviet Russia jokes. wtf first of all. It cannot be called Soviet Russia. It is either Soviet Union or Russia or Russian Federation. that bothers me the most because I am Russian.  What is up with the jokes I appreciate a joke about Russia but this is pathetic atleast be creative enough to make a joke and not just make every joke in Soviet Russia facebook updates you! this and that does you. ect ! wtf that's not even a joke. Other than that I really like this app and would recommend it to my friends! but you guys need to update your Soviet Russia jokes or just take it off the list.	4
4639757	Okay, Amazon, WTF!!!!!! THE APP WILL NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! IT KEEPS FAILING EVERYTIME!!!!!!!! Tried downloading regular, tried downloading via the WiFi connection!!!! Will not download either which way!!!!!	1
4640395	While this has the potential to be an entertaining app for some, (I will give an extra star for trying)  I can't believe that you are charging $.99 for this when you don't even have the most important word of the app spelled correctly.  It is LIAR, not LIER. I didn't even know what this app was supposed to be because I read it as it seems, &quot;Findlier&quot; or &quot;Find-lier&quot; as in more findly (wtf is more findly or findlier?  lol) like it's &quot;friendlier&quot; as in more friendly...just a thought and hope it makes sense :)	2
4641262	absolutely loved this game but then the glitches started....my buildings&hellip;crops and animals all told me ready to collect but there was nothing to collect....then after a week of that....the timers reset and now tell me 400hrs....wtf....fix it already	2
4641278	this app had very funny jokes but some didn't make sense other wise its pretty funny I almost wet myself u strongly recommend. it. its so funny I'm like WTF&iexcl;!!!!!!	5
4644063	I don't understand I've been playing this game for awhile and I have never seen a permission so could some one tell wtf is going with permission!!!!!!	5
4644251	Now I'm going to have to agree with WTF lol, why would amazon choose an app that's only intended for women. Do young men want to take advice on how to train and workout our legs from females!? do females want us, young males to start shaving our legs to look more attractive to these unintelligent beings of nature (lmao, jk). My answer is NO! that's right I said that, and guess what!... I'm sexy and I know it dun dun dun dun :D no seriously 1 star for a female working out app trolololoollololol :p<br /><br />(parents beware, app contains female activities! '-')	1
4644654	*** Disclaimer ***<br />Marc Maron on the WTF podcast curses. A lot. He's also a gifted interviewer, a quick wit, has anger issues, succumbs to fits of self-loathing and can bring out the very best of his guests. Its a long form interview of typically close to an hour. Some are funny, others are poignant, others may not suit. All are tinged with humor filled with the best of intentions peppered with more curse words than some want to count. Marc is a comedian you should hear at least once, see live at least once and once in your life contribute to his continued ability to perform.	5
4646342	at first itslikr wtf klnda game is this but then u  get it the graphics are aawesome i loooove it	4
4646969	I am so mad at my kids for what they text. they have used wtf!? WTF! I LOVE THIS app. so helpful.	5
4647050	This game kept making noises at me any time something happened on it... even with the volume turned off on my Kindle... and the Kindle in sleep mode.<br />Wtf? I shouldn't be woken in the middle of the night by a stupid time-killer game.	2
4649269	first off, the pic 4 the game looks sooooooo wrong:(  I wuz literally gagging when I first saw it and caught myself even saying &quot;wtf?!&quot; I haven't even got the game and I already giv it a zero!( well technichally I can but still...) no questions asked. also, picking ur acne and scabs? PUS? that is just disgusting and retarded! ZERO!	1
4650308	"Installed this morning on my Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 and it will NOT sync up with my Facebook account.<br />It just says \\""Oops, connection was lost.  Please try again later\\"" over and over again.  Facebook works fine.<br />What gives?  Fix this and I will change my rating.<br /><br />EDIT:  Played it for awhile without Facebook, and was up to over 4600 coins.  Then a window popped up asking me to rate the app.  I clicked no, and it wiped out my funds.  WTF is going on with this?  This game is fun on Facebook, but the app SUCKS."	1
4650508	everytime I try to put a pic to edit it just gives me the options again! wtf the really need to fix it for kindelfire:/	2
4652546	why in the hell did I get the game for I thout it was something different but no it is sick :( don't. be stupid. and don't get this game.who ever invented this app I am coming for u and I am going to slap u so hard my hand print will stay on your face forever and ever and ever like I said WTF!?	1
4652693	I didn't get the app but I was looking through the reveiws and did anyone else c that one girl who wrote people say this app is stupid are stupid and then said people should stop judging based on other people oppinions like seriously wtf I have no faith in this generation	1
4656441	greetings fellow amazonians I was getting onto the bus this morning when I saw kokabot. wtf seriously koka? I have been in peru and I know what they do with koka so I guess I know what this bot is really looking for; not little stars. im giving five starts since the developer pulled the wool over the eyes of amazons standards department and I may stop by rodney on the street corner because im starting to get a craving.	5
4660938	I really want to like this app, but every time I take a picture and go to edit, it force closes, WTF!? every time!! I tried contacting the developer and haven't gotten a response its been over a month!!	1
4662608	amazon should require dev. to include info of how much space is needed.  its pretty much bs that people have to buy the game to figure out how much storage is required.  its deceptive to say its a couple megs and then you buy the game not knowing if there is an additional 500mb or 700mb or wtf!  whats the big deal? let us know so we can manage our kindle fires ridiculous memory space!	5
4663789	all my purchased goodies are gone since the upgrade!WTF!! got extras from the store then did the upgrade. now the ads are back! urgh	2
4665015	I buy this game and can even open it wtf  ? I mean you pay 6.99 you really want to be able to open it	1

4669622	This game needs you to regester just to play the rest of the TWO more levels I mean seriously. I can but no wtf I don't wanna go through tht crap.	1
4670914	I like the idea of this game but when I downloaded it I was disappointed. first of all the ball is slow,  no matter how much I tilted my tablet the ball would now go at the same speed. secondly the game is boring,  it says its theme is wood but that's not true in fact its white with brown lines plus the extra stuff they add doesn't help the game,  for example extra balls just makes the game difficult. I mean like WTF.	1
4672320	Horrible horrible frame rate on the Kindle which has a dual core processor. (its runs better on my xperia play which has a single 1 ghz processor!!!!wtf) Costs too much. Lack of multiplayer options. Garbage.	1
4672916	After install wants all kinds of personal info before you can use it, wtf!?<br />Do not install unless you like giving away personal info to just try out a app.	1
4672977	it worked for a while and now it tells me I cannot connect to the Internet ..before u start trolling I am connected. obviously because I am typing this now on my of thru the market. totally restored my of to stock with no change .. I don't know wtf is up but I'm no amateur so if there's a trick Pls let me know but so far this has turned out to be a total drag.	2
4674868	just like the other reviews it sucks WTF it always glitches I uninstalled it like right as I got it	1
4675374	needs an update. I really am tired of walking, then it turns around all of a sudden. I'm like... wtf!	4
4675453	The game will allow me to play for about 1 minute and then it says &quot;ball lost&quot;. WTF?!? HATE IT.	1
4675640	if it was more like the original. game fine but its not. NO LEARNING PHASE some of the icons you don't know what they do (ie) the sheriff star? ?? wtf is that for ......??? you get lost and confused. wish someone would fix the real ORIGINAL. game for a app.nthen they would have something. only good thing is you font waste $$$$ BUT THE TIME you use finding out that its not worth the freenpart. ALL HALE THE ORIGINAL GAME BTING THAT TO US. then it would be fun.	3
4676456	when I try to download it it says all the time that I need 465MB to install. and I have no other games. or any thing. WTF is going on!!!	1
4677914	all u do is press a button! and it talks to u about hell! wtf is wrong with this app!	2
4677934	the only good thing about this app is that its easy to UNINSTALL!!! It sounded like a great app, exactly what a music junkie like me would want....OR NOT. i installed it, found a vid i wanted to watch, and then...ERROR. WTF!? it did that with EVERY vid i tapped on. the app never actually worked. i installed it more than once and have still never watched a video on it. its crap. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!	1
4678261	Ok I saw it said permission and I was like WTF? NEVER HAD THAT ON OTHER APPS. BUT it did update...slowly.	3
4681665	you have got to be kidding me. my favorite app that I can no longer play. FIX IT SOON! like this is not okaay. wtf .	1
4684074	it takes 2 seconds to run out of energy then wtf do u do??????? takes 2 seconds to reach level 5 then it ducks.	4
4684534	only wworked for one cramming week! WTF! Very dissatisfied with this app. It needs a major Overhaul. I guess I will reload it because I love netflix!	2
4687355	wtf were these idiots thinking?!?!?!? Being a young woman, I find this idiotic game EXTREMELY offensive! What sane person would create such a horrible game?!?!?!?!?!??!? WTF?!?	1
4687448	I have been using the free version and liked it. so I thought that I would upgrade... and their was no difference! wtf is that don't waste ur money and get the free version	1
4687533	found mysterious frickin ad on the state bar - that is excruciatingly annoying!!  as if I would actually download or buy anything it advertised !!! puhleez wtf<br /><br />a true shame BC this is a great app otherwise.  a vastly wide variety of fairly difficult arcade mini games that aren't mastered in one or two tries. JUST challenging enough to make you want to keep trying.  you are awarded with extra points too for persistence which helps you unlock other games (good if you just can't master one or don't like it or just want more variety.<br /><br />if someone can find a less intrusive or scheming (trickery) to advertise, you can make a million by gathering these types of mini games. hell, I might do that myself. LOL	2
4689185	&lt;3 i love this game...so much fun! x o x o x o x o x o!! !! !!  omg foh wtf fyl	5
4689311	Once again, I've found another waiting game, but this one is fun and has little waiting. I love that expansions happen instantly and so do buildings. The crappy part is waiting for magic spells to recharge so you can collect crops and taxes. Also, it drains battery fast, but works flawlessly on MY Kindle Fire, I don't know wtf is wrong with yours.	5
4689386	Omg......u have nooooooooooooo idea how funny it was to see my dad pissed off...ahhhhh sooooo funny...and the best part was the fact that my mom was in on this prank too...it looks so real...its redic...Omg.................my mom helped me pic out which one looked the most convincing...its this one...and right after it finished downloading to my kindle fire...my mom came up wit a great idea to make a loud noise to make it seem like I  dropped it... and she said wtf wat did u dooo ...so then my dad came in the room and I said...Omg and covered my mouth...like I was surprised...we show him the screen and he said...reallllyyyy thts the only thing tht we don't have insurance on ................then we told him cuz he was getting mad ......blah blah blah .......BUT THIS IS 1 OF THE FUNNEST AND BEST APPS EVER, PAID OR FREE....................U HAVE TO BUY....IF U DONT UR A WEENIE ...JUST SAYN......<br />...	5
4693220	Igor it on the kindle fire, of course, it doesn't even play the music!!! wtf is up with that?!?! all they guy does is swing his arms and lift his legs up and down. WTF... it stinks	2
4694834	Had an update a few days ago that added alerts option (i assumed just like the text alerts).  Thought this was great since Sprint yanked it from their services.  Now a new update and alerts gone?  WTF?	3
4696634	I like this app because unlike 95% of FAOTD, I have a job, a passport, friends etc.<br />I travel to Germany, London and the Netherlands several times a year. I have friends who enjoy hearing from me.<br />But the purpose of this is to state that Superman75 is played out and wtf is the man.<br />I mean join the fun.  Amazon encourages silly reviews that instead of reviewing you promote the fact that you will NEVER get paid to write.  Entertain the troll community.  Thanks Amazon.	4
4699096	Game is a Time Crisis ripoff and you have to spin real money to progress<br />. Sad scam indeed.<br />wtf with that	2
4700093	Though why when today it was the free app of the day with an update in the play market... WTF Amazon really, REALLR thats how awsome Amzon is...#$%&amp;#@!	4
4702632	After playing the free version of this game for months, I picked the paid version up as the free app of the day a while back. Then, I started noticing some quirky stuff.<br /><br />Why does this game REQUIRE internet access to be played? If I lose my cell connection in the boondocks or a concrete building, then I cannot play fruit ninja. Wtf?!?<br /><br />Why does this PAID app need to access my camera and my contacts? There is something seriously wrong with that.<br /><br />Also, after having played this game for all of 20 minutes, my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus showed a drop of 40% battery life. Checking the battery stats showed me that it was 95% fruit ninja's fault. I also noticed that over 50% of the mobile data I had used that day was used by fruit ninja. BUYER BEWARE!	1
4704433	jeep uuuu huh jeep uuuu whyyyyyyyy wtf eft stupipt idiot don't get it bye ghhh bgggv gggg hhhhh iiii fffff uuuuuuu	1
4705687	i got the app then i pranked some people in my family then whenever i launched the app i quit it then whenever i touched something it would launch the app wtf!!! you should change that do not get i deleted it	1
4706694	WTF? Not working with kindle fire? Good job amazon, seriously WTF? Further more, why are the free app of the day apps getting so crummy? They seemed better in the first few months, and young child apps? What a wad. Like I am going to let a kid play with my kindle fire, but I guessing that's why I am bitching about a free app.	1
4707658	wow $3 for a free app on every damn phone I mean really?  wtf?! I think its time for a real tablet!samsung seams to be rocking the tablet world maybe today is the day.the fire looks like its dying out like a candle in the wind.maybe its rooting time.	3
4710895	nothin tp say it suks waste of time no challenge n some items have to b bought in teal money wtf uhg	1
4711124	I'm experiencing same issue as others...sits on the main screen &quot;loading&quot;, but never does - goes to black, then closes...wtf??? C'mon Rovio, you really need to get this fixed! AB lovers would like to give space a test drive!!!	1
4714222	the players are all sick dudes wanting LOVE AND BABIES and if I could ban this. game I would tots do it also bad bad bad wtf???	1
4717822	really good app wish instead of &quot;try again&quot; would tell you the item you choosed... other than that i love it and so does my boys... and i dont know wtf we gotta leave these long ass reviews	5
4719679	this is the worst knock off game yet. bassically you don't draw there are just a lot of people chatting &quot;hi&quot;  and &quot;wtf is going on&quot;. worst app ive gotten.	1
4733465	5 stars, 2 thumbs up, 100% like, omg wtf bbq dairy queen, still wants me to input eight more words.	5
4733744	This app can be really funny but it just said I'm a young Adolf Hitler. WTF!?!? This app is really mean. Its bad for kids.	2
4733843	"My initial evaluation of this app was positive. But after using it for a few months, I am deleting it. I much prefer a paper copy, and find the digital version unsatisfactory. The magazines take up way too much memory, and are very slow to load, especially the larger editions such as September. Resolution is ok, but you lose the small details that just can't be seen. And the app is very slow to load, with navigation that is often problematic, especially when it scrolls down a page. Just not worth it. Plus, orders and subscriptions are difficult... to find on Amazon's web pages. Also, I seem to have just purchased the October issue. While I was trying to clear out several issues from my Kindle, a popup came up saying the October issue was available. To clear the popup, which said ZIP about purchasing - and I cancelled the subscription last month - a \\""purchased\\"" label suddenly appeared on the October issue icon. WTF? Anyway, I've deleted the app and hopefully all copies and will contest any additional charges that may show up. Just don't bother with this app, that would be my advice."	1
4736742	when I first trim d this game it was awesome! then after three times u went back in the app and pressed categories, nothing appeared. WTF!?	2
4736870	don't get this game its not fun at all &amp; your just suck in a jail cell looking for items and its like a paper clip and a bottlecap. wtf? don't get it	1
4736929	I love its awesome I.don't.lille that the flu points are hard to egrt. like pmg wtf does that that's juice so get it and enjoy it I like talking to much.for.my huge paragraph so contact 911 for emaegenceys for ya truly I get.flu points.for this.like.I<br /> sad	5
4741737	Should have been a live wallpaper. And wtf network permissions? Pass on this one, friends, not worth even the pride of free. Optimus users, you aren't missing much.	2
4741861	this game is so cool I couldn't stop playingg it when I got it for Christmas its almost like forza 4 upgrade ur car and realistic racing so awesome and screw th other people who give it 1 star wtf its amazing	5
4746720	the controls make this game almost unplayable. it is beautiful and scary but the control are imprecise and overloaded so you spend time wrestling with the controls and constantly die because you cant tap fast enough?? wtf. please read the reviews and fix instead of lowering the price. this could be a much pricier game if they just fixed it!	2
4747871	definitely not worth it, a great waste of time honestly, I was like wtf when I tried it out, and uninstalled immediately	1
4748476	"I have a Droid X. I have paid for premium WTF access. Now I'm unable to download this app, and when I went to \\""Send Feedback\\"" to Amazon, that dialog box wouldn't send. This is ridiculous. No matter how many times I enter my phone number or email address nothing happens. What the hell am I supposed to do? This is ridiculous."	1
4748690	Initially, I loved this game. Good leveling experience, the recipes were fun, the graphics are very decent, and the social part was kinda fun as well. But a lot of the really fun stuff that you can buy with your restaurant can only be bought with gems, which is, ok...you do get a limited amount but the developers made it so rediculously easy to accidentally spend you gems...probably to encourage you too spend your real-life money on replenishing them. But I completely stopped playing this game when, after 20 levels of saving and collecting gems, I accidentally spent nearly all of them, in 4 accidental transactions in 2 days! Wtf. I would have paid a subscription! But to be &quot;tricked&quot; into spending something I leveled and worked hard to collect destroyed the experience for me. :(	1
4750504	addicting and now i have an ipad 2. Already got my brother hooked on it lol. didnt care for that last update lost all my cars and rp and loot. The damn bosses are the cars i did have wtf thats dirty but I've always wanted to race myself. I would have to say I'm pretty good cause I'm stuck on level 2 lol	5
4752144	...useless and worthless... purchased... installed... configured settings... nothing worked... and then rebooted... still nothing worked... found an update on Google's Android Marketplave up to 2.0 for another charge!!! purchased... installed... configured settings... nothing worked... and then rebooted... still nothing worked... WTF?!!! I'm refraining to be meaner!!!	1
4757878	At first I thought......WTF! I gave it a chance and I am impressed! Very punny non game. yes, I said punny. (Thumbs up!)	5
4760378	this game is so gay it should not even get a star. the people have no hands or feet. wtf! what is with the title, it sounds like weewee. who even create this game!?!? it sucks!	1
4764068	well, the time I downloaded this I was shy. it showed: you are shy. next: you are angry. WTF?!?! IM NOT SHY! next: you are a crybaby. after a few moments playing brake your screen, it said: you are malicious.	3
4764536	this game is one of the stupidest games I have ever played. it sucks more than the happy poo game. wtf, how are you supposed to jump when you taxi goes a whole woppen 1mile per hour. why are there so many other cars, were on a race track, not new York city. who invented this game anyway, it sucks!? I dislike people.	1
4765360	this game is terrible. you get two faces out of like 12. the only way to get more faces is to buy the real game, wtf. I don't understand how the people who make these games are making money. they are rotting the last little IQ points that some of us have.why do these people try, it just ends up as a disaster.	1
4767567	not seeing video at all wtf. shows in the description a video of a person doing the exercise but no video on app. Failsauce!!!	1
4768556	awesome game. hope i dont get stuck at some point since im a jew and wont spend money. Awesome graphics but no blood real (wtf)	5
4769685	I've been listening to WTF for a while and purchased this to support Marc. The app is super useful. It allows for downloading the podcasts if you're offline. My biggest concern with a podcast player is that it will consistently remember my location and this does it without fail. I really like the ability to star the podcasts to quickly go back to the ones that I want to listen to.	5
4772592	doesn't work on my new kindle fire. wtf?! Total waist of $3. That's all I have to say about that.	1
4772976	maybe they cant read but its tru the app is wack wtf is rong wid dem ppl, btw u shouldn't even view da app its terrible	1
4773049	Who comes up with this crap? No pun intended, but seriously man, polish a turd? At what point in the development pc this app Did this game sound appealing, wtf?	2
4774350	would be a great game, but the stupid thing keeps pausing constantly!!!! can't even get thru one scene without wanting to scream. makes me choose wrong tiles or restart at the very end!!!!!!  does the same on my galaxy , tablet, and my touch. crap!!!!!!! Plus I agree with everyone else. wtf is up with spamming more crap???	1
4774448	I really want to be more skeptical of this app. But I've removed the variables it measures on some things it detects... and I can't explain wtf, just happened. If its a subject that intrigues you. I really recommend this app (I ended up upgrading to the paid app). For entertainment only, it can be a blast.	5
4774511	this is a bad app when I got it I singed in and it took like a week to sing in and when it singed in it stayed singed it for like 30 mins and never singed back in so wtf DONT BUY IT OR GRT FOR FREE!!!!	1
4775377	I spent some tokens o. leveling up, and then it told me I had enough tokens to buy the next level, but I didn't and then it told me to buy more tokens.WTF!!?	1
4775875	Mechanics work well, the game is a little easy though, but an overall fun game to play in your free time. Nothing hardcore, but wtf do you expect from a tablet\smartphone game?!	4
4777795	I don't get some of these reviews like the one about. wtf does your pizza issues got to do with this app? Amazon needs to ban those types from being allowed to review apps because they. don't take it serious at all.	5
4778226	it wont update!  wtf i really want kindles to not share w/ phone apps.  that's about all i can say about this app &times;&bull;_&bull;&times;<br /><br /> ~kindle fire	2
4778265	I immediately uninstalled this after seeing its permssion.vending.billing, wtf all these faotd are changing their permissions when updating you better check yours too	1
4779254	I was going to download this app; however, I decided not to after reviewing the permissions it requires. Read and write to your contact list and record sms messages? wtf? No thank you...	1
4782279	it great but no many people hack and don't get there data reset and when I got a hacked wep I got my data erased like wtf why don't they get there stuff reset	4
4782647	Discovering Marc and WTF has been incredible. He's able to draw out people's very personal stories and insights. My grandfather was a comedian for 45 years and I feel I understand him so much better now. I love Maron, keep up the good work.<br /><br />For all the users whining about the app: it isn't the app you dopies, it's your crappy phones. Works perfect on my DI. No glitches at all.	5
4784379	warning.watching this will haunt you for life.do not buy u will wish u didn't.I do so if u buy u will be like this :O wtf is this but if u don't buy u will be like : ) I'm glad I didnt	1
4785460	o my gah it is like lufondalicios I would friggin marry this sexy app (I even proposed)  o my gab wtf omega I love the dictionary tata	5
4788060	another kids app wtf???I agree with Curtis sheets. 200 devices not intended for children these apps blow I'm guessing tomorrows app is learn how to count,speak,draw,read sucks.	1
4788121	this game gives you the opposite feeling than you feel its so stupid when I was happy it said I was malicious like honestly WTF!!!!!! royalty not worth buying	1
4789305	As I wrote in an email to wtfpod@gmail.com:  PLEASE NOTE: THIS AMAZON MARKETPLACE APP IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SEVERAL MODELS OF ANDROID PHONES, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE 2.2 OR HIGHER OPERATING SYSTEM.  This is Marc's version of the New Coke, the Edsel car and Microsoft's Zune -- bad ideas, badly implemented.  Please consider forwarding this to Marc for his personal review.  I'm a longtime fan -- in fact, I'm the guy at Arlington drafthouse who gave Marc a copy of the Kenneth Tynan profiles book.  The switch to Amazon marketplace is a huge hassle for many Android phone users. We have to go into settings and allow third party downloads not from Android marketplace, our premium year-long payment to Android marketplace isn't credited towards this new  app, and  after trying the download -- which admittedly is free for now -- it's not compatible with my Android phone, Optimus LG V with virgin mobile...it seems that the Amazon android marketplace is more compatible with Android AT&T phones than any other cell phone company.  It could cost Marc's show thousands of listeners via smartphones on Android.  Why did you switch from the fairly loosely regulated Android marketplace to the far more restrictive Amazon marketplace for the Android app? The loss in listeners won't be made up by whatever larger cut of the app sales you may be getting from Amazon. I have all the Amazon purchasing apps on my smartphone, including the Amazon android appstore app for download, and the WTF Android app from Amazon still isn't compatible with my phone.  Any suggestions? Is this hassle to your fans and listeners worth it in irritation and frustration?  Also, if you're in the Amazon marketplace, your WTF pod tech people need to get a list from Amazon marketplace of which exact phone models and carriers are not comptabile with the Amazon marketplace WTF app, post it on your webpage, not expect Amazon to do it (they hide that list unless you dig it out through various clicks and searches), and create awork-around, so people don't waste the time and effort to download an app that won't work.  Or just return to the Android marketplace. If you want a larger cut of the Android marketplace sales, negotiate with Android marketplace or just raise the price of the app.  In the meantime, tell your listeners via the web and on radio, you can hear each week's podcast via Stitcher,and past recent episodes are also hearable via stitcher. Full array of episodes from a long time ago are not available from stitcher, but it's a start.  I had to reboot my phone's operating system, so my old Android WTF app that I paid for in the marketplace uner my gmail account,but it no longer functions and I was hoping to reinstall the WTF app from the Android market. No such luck.  Also, for Marc, the claim that switching to a hassle-prone Amazon marketplace is something your listeners have been clamoring for, along with registering at yet another website as well,(MyLibsyn Account) is not credible -- and is the sort of claim that governments and corporations make when making unpleasant changes that I'm sure Marc has lampooned in the past at some point.  This COMPLEX, multiple setep method isn't as easy and intuitive as downloading from Android marketplace. This is Marc's version of the New Coke, the Edsel car and Microsoft's Zune -- bad ideas, badly implemented.  Please improve and fix as soon as you can...  Sincerely,  Art	1
4791395	says f word 3 times! can only hide it and easy to show hidden! was in subway and hit wtf boom didn't know what it was. do now	4
4791588	i was sitting there wen it said die i was like wtf? the next day my uncle was DEAD. please say in a review if this is real or not if it is it would help me belief he is in a better place. refer to me as beastliness hobby	5
4791792	This is crap. You use to be able to buy just the paper with the old kindle.Now you need a subscription? WTF? Add to that the app was caught in a loop and I couldn't even register for a subscription. What garbage.	1
4795044	Mine only lets you crack light bulbs and Uv rays wtf?!?!?????!?!?!??? It also does not look realistic at all, it makes a sound as if a rock hit it and not lets say the floor	1
4795908	its ok I guess but every time I tried to go to settings it would force close and one of the things was not a compliment it said devil face wtf anyways if you wants to get it suit yourself	3
4798485	Suddenly stopped working this morning. No sound. Its critical I get this working because I'm a medical student who relies on this app to wake up at 4 am every morning. wtf?!?!?!	1
4802800	really WTF its a whip and its black. only cool things bout it. its just a pic and you cant make it move anywhere deleting now!	1
4803031	this app is freaking stupid!! it wouldn't respond to my commands, I press forward and the freaking dude slows down... Wtf!!	1
4803317	WTF not even purchasing the app. You frikken creepers want a app for 3D sex moves?? WTF is wrong wit yew???	1
4804432	lame, why such lame apps wtf? I can't stand all these kid games they give away give out something real ppl can use	1
4807880	everytime I win it shuts off..and restarts my kindle. Doesn't happen if I don't win..wtf. The graphics are good but the engine takes some time getting used to.	2
4809147	I paid good money for this game.  I originally installed it on my phone and it worked great, but it's so damned big I had to uninstall it.  So, I installed it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0+ and it looks like hell. When I bought it, there was NOTHING that said it was not compatible with tablets.  It seems it's not compatible with newer phones, either.  WTF *is* it compatible with?	1
4809170	this app sucks it is a waste of time and money it said free but it lies the only people who would play this and say its great are people with no lives and are social shut ins WTF  from whatsittoya	1
4809475	So wait it's just a game... just blood .. just killing animals... just chopping them... it's our food... ! wtf.. even professional butchers would'nt chop them cruely like this. If you download this game and enjoy playing it. Good for you!  * I see that it's mostly girls who have commented against this and I know there are some real men out there who feels the same way.	1
4809613	I don't like it. it would not dowload on my kindle fire but the free version does work wtf s o stupid	1
4810842	Someone said: &quot;It's a cute talking ball for little kids.&quot; WTF are you thinking. 1.CUTE?We might as well call Lady Gaga and Frankenstein cute.That thing is CREEPING THE UNOWUT OUTTA ME 2.Talking?It doesn't record on tablets.I dunno about other phones. 3.Little kids.You might as well encourage little kids to play with that psycho murderer over there.I'm 10 years old.If I'm scared by a picture--the only other time that happened was when I saw the cover of the book 44--then little kids will be TERRIFIED. I had the sense to NOT get this.You do the same.	1
4812399	The game itself is good but the business model Gameloft chose to go with on this game sucks. I want to be able to pay a 1 time fee to play the game and then own it. I don't want to have to perpetually pay money for &quot;energy&quot; to play the game. You'll end up paying full console game money on a game that should cost 10 bucks at the absolute most. Also, its kinda funny that they're charging real money (not fake in game money)  for things like new outfits and golf clubs. I can't bring myself to cough up 2 bucks so my digital guy could get a new pair of pants. Wtf!?	1
4812957	Great grapics but agree with the other reviews.  Not much to do, &amp; paying to breed?  WTF?  At least in &quot;Bird Land&quot; you can pet the birds &amp; they respond. Here you have to chase them around 'poking' at  them.... LoL That wouldn't make ME 'happy'! !  Uninstalled in under 1 week.  Yawn!	2
4814374	this app was just awful :( waste of time!! after downloading and trying to install, it said my hardware was not supported, wtf???	1
4815010	I loved it @ first. Now it's not going anywhere! Can't get past level 10 for 2 wks. Just realized it's asking me to match light blue birds, they're ARE NO light blue birds! WTF?	3
4816759	I bought this on my tablet for my son in kindergarten. He its learning his coins. This thing us nothing more than a calculator using the couple of coins on the screen. No other options, no sound. It stinks. I went for a refund within 45 seconds if opening three app. No refunds in the Amazon store? WTF?	2
4817341	this fact game sucks because ..........there are no cool fact.  WTF I mean that this sucks even if it has good facts the set up Is dumb	1
4819125	Cool to bring tablet to school and play dubstep in class and make people like wtf when the wonder what im doing	5
4825601	this is literally the easier way to download music, videos. i use this to download and then transfer it my comp. i was looking for a app like this forever and when i found this i was like WTF this is free.	5
4825670	this app is boring. sorry. wtf. do I really need an app to write down my dreams. It useful for folks that need it I guess. I downloaded it cause it was free and I thought it analyzed your  dreams. it doesn't	1
4826324	I gave the game three stars because I like to play it but the ad for mr.Mixit is grossly annoying.  I even tried to buy the program Mr. Mixit just to get rid of the ad but it is not recommended for Kindle Fire.  Another thing that has happened to me twice while I was playing. I lost a letter. I was moving letters around a lot and when I was almost finished a letter was missing so I could not complete the game. WTF??? How does something get released with such a glaring programming error.  How about an update to get rid of the ads and fix the programming error.	3
4829443	So I beat the game, love it...but there is no zen garden.  And the mini games are different from pc.  My wife played as well and no zen garden.  Wtf?  I will play thru a secind time, but will be pissed if no zen garden.  Anyone else experience this?	4
4831863	When I am not swearing I would say this: The most stupidiest app in the world like wtf Don't buy it waste of time!	1
4833905	I just got a new update for this app, I downloaded it and now the app does not work. wtf!!!!!	4
4834563	I see there is an update for the app on the Market. So... Wtf? It's been there for a while, why would you not put the update on here? I can't update from the market, or I would. I use this app daily so thank you for it, but crashes sometimes and I'm sure an update would help, and would be appreciated.	4
4836135	my phone is supported, i put my number in to have email sent..... nothing. screen doesnt load. Email doesnt come. Help amazon! wtf?!?!?!?!	1
4836769	I typed terraria and this came up! wtf!! wtf!! wtf!! I dislike minecraft anyway. now typing to make this revew long	1
4837808	**WARNING: This app &amp; the following review contain strong sexual content.**<br /><br />!! On the 2nd random fact page it explained how certain foods alter the TASTE of semen!!! WTF?!?<br /><br />The entire app is peppered with irrelevant sexual factoids such as 'longest recorded erect penis', 'calories per teaspoon of semen', ad nauseum.<br /><br />That is an utterly sensationalist and irresponsible app.<br /><br />I'd planned to use this as a learning tool for my daughter, but was instead  floored by the inordinate amount of entries with blatantly lurid overtones.	1
4839995	The app claims this is a free app. But when I try to download it, it tells me I need to buy it. wtf.	1
4841789	Some were hard and did not make sense. And seriously, giraffe. Wtf. But I guess kids will like it. buy it for them. Or, if your drunk.	3
4844064	Hey Amazon, are you really letting ads on paid versions? Wtf is going on here? Paid means no ads! We need to stand up and not download any paid apps with ads. Read the comments before downloading! Horrible!	1
4845031	its obviously a serious troll, or a virus. just look at the permissions: sound recording? info about networks? wtf? seriously?	1
4845367	Just like the computer. Game plays good.wish there were different deck styles. WTF does this review have to be 20 our more word.	4
4845914	ok guys I have a kindle fire and wtf there is nothing wrong with the app its free and when you open it its just performing an update is a little boring after a while but still somewhat fun it didn't ask me for any info so idk what u guys r TLKIN about..... dnt listen to the bad reviews its ok and not &quot;sketchy&quot; but does make me wonder how it got to the top app tho	3
4846511	"I keep this app in my cloud only because the quality of the show is so good. Its extensive archive is unavailable on Stitcher and TuneIn. Otherwise, it would be banished.  When Kindle Fire said its memory was running low, I had to delete most apps from my device, including this one. The deleted WTF app left a folder that I had to manually delete. I only knew that because I was using AndroXplorer / ES File to figure out why my SD card was still full. This is one of several apps that left data behind when I thought it was supposed to all be \\""in the cloud.\\""  I still haven't figured out why my SD card is so full, though. So I may have to correct this and other reviews if it turns out that the industry's best practice is to leave behind a folder labeled with your name on it (as opposed to dumping it into a system-labeled file, who knows)."	3
4846942	it told me its not compatible with my device, like wtf? i want my money back. a total waste of .99$	1
4847779	This is the most ridiculous app I have ever seen! don't waste your time downloading it. Who wants to pretend today cookies and drink milk? wtf!?!	1
4849006	for the dummies who think that this game never downloads you suck. I mean wtf is wrong with you. just be patient for once in your life. this game is awesome if you give it some time to download.peace out gameloft, unlike some people, you rock	5
4850798	I got this app for my kindle fire so I could download videos to watch later (outside of wifi areas) now I can't even watch videos period, they cut out ten seconds in saying it's an unsupported format. wtf do I do about this BS?!!!&quot;	1
4851079	I play this game all the time online and was stoked to see it available for the Kindle Fire. Unfortunately like the other reviewer said, you can't get past typing your name in. There is no submit button, your keyboard doesn't have one either, and you can't swipe out of the screen! Wtf?! :(	1
4851111	I wish I would have read the reviews first because I got this app and it SUCKS!! i have the kindle fire and the mic.doesn't even work like wtf? whoever evented this and got it to the app store is a genius because how do you create a app so pointless and get it on here? anyway... can you delete this app?	1
4852729	I said my mom loves me the ball said My sources say no wtf but it is pretty cool lol	1
4853558	I just hated that I would get up and then throw sevens every other friggin throw! wtf is that all about!?	1
4855092	okay, the game looks fine, loaded quick, but when the actual game started is when all that goes out the window.  This game has some of the worst controls I've ever encountered within a game.  Even attempting the &quot;tutorial&quot; results in a wtf were they thinking, you'll be stuck up a wall in no time.  Tilt controls aren't even implemented and there isn't even an option to enable traditional on-screen controls.  Avoid this game and don't even waste your money, unless you have money to throw away.  There are better games to be had.  Dev:  Fix the controls in an update and I'll reconsider my review.	1
4855682	this really suks cause ive tried downloading it to my kindle fire but it wont let me....wtf.....when's it gonna get fixed	1
4858353	to the person who says there is no capricorn.wtf there is Capricorn! I would rate 5 stars. it has my constalation Leo.	5
4859646	cute and fun at first but wtf is up with the sudden black screen? after hrs of the screen going black it went back to normal. but then I realized how boring this game was so I uninstalled it. I'm just glad that I bought this free instead of the original price because it would be a waste of money if I spent even 1 penny on this stupid app.	1
4860785	I heart it so much I was like wtf is this and are u telling me Santa not real what the duck is this	5
4860885	All of a sudden says contacting all the people in my addressbook! WTF!  No asking permission - it just does it. Nothing should ever do that. DELETE!    Shame cannot do less than one star.	1
4862157	DO NOT BUY its like save this cow tottaly sucks these people say its great WTF I'm never gonna buy cow games what's is	1
4862490	Worked fine for about 3 minutes, then an ominous black screen appeared and I could no longer play, even after an app restart, but I could still hear the music. Um, wtf?	1
4863290	updated and lost all my cars and stats! such a fail... fix this asap. yes I got this app for free but Wtf. don't screw us that got lucky and got the free app dl from amazon... was a 5 star app now I have to pick a 1 star.	1
4869019	It has 2 games for free the rest you buy for 99 cents. Really?!? The games are over 20 years old wtf!	1
4870484	I really want the app Minecraft pocket edition. What's the point to have an app to change your person when you don't have the game? Wtf?	1
4873872	Link was sent, clicked to download, tried to open and received an error,was sent to the Market where it diverted me back to Amazon to sign in then sent me to purchase area? WTF? UNINSTALLED...Bottom line...just go directly to the Android Market to get your free downloads.  It is simply not necessary to get them here.	1
4875007	when I click 3 mo. free, in app  all I get is $1.99 ea or $19.99 mo. wtf? I am not curious enough to subscribe for $ not clear how to avoid a charge.	1
4875263	this dang app wont even install. why bother trying if its gonna go for 2 hours with me pressing install over and over again but it keeps saying install?? WTF????	1
4876602	This app doesn't freaking work!!!!!!! Wtf? I downloaded and installed it and it didn't work... I really think this sucks. Waste my freaking time!!!	1
4877916	I payed for this app. I have played this app. Now all of a sudden, it's not authorized on my device? WTF?	2
4877942	PHONECALLS? WTF MAKES ABS NO SENSE BOYCOTT THIS APP MOMS AND DADS UNITE TO PROTECT OUR KIDS AND PRIVACY!!!!! GODBLESS......I XPECTED BETTER OF AMAZON	1

4881500	this app duznt have my printer model. wtf am I supposed to do? waste of $12!!!! I want my money back now!	1
4881695	Program worked great on my kindle fire, but when I saved a file closed it and tried to re-open it the app says &quot;Cannot open file&quot; wtf I paid $5 for this app. Amazon needs to fix a lot of issues with their apps....	2
4886537	I am sad to see that this has gone completely off the market. wtf gameloft and amazon? please bring this back to kindle fire. would love to be able to play an MMO on here!	1
4886960	this game is awesome but why do people say it needs a update? it has the toolbox thing already.it has like 2 more boxes after the toolbox one! wtf but the gameplay is awsome	5
4887786	Out there!!!!!!77!77 you can't find a better app and this elegant. Filler file filler Fuller... Wtf word limit, God. I'm just adding more words so I can post the review,jeez	5
4888205	i am paying for a base to pay for more games?wtf atari! this is plain stupid i wounldnt get it even if you offered it for free this app is everything that is bad in apps.	1
4888471	This is a great app that I use on my phone. It's for all us lazy people who want others to do the work for us. Unfourtantly, on the Kindle Fire this app seems to do the opposite. It's listed in the Appstore but when I downloaded it, it told me it's not compatiable with my device? WTF Amazon? Why list it if it won't work? I don't like stock keyboard and by locking me out from installing another one while offering alternatives in the Appstore is just plain moronic. Fix it or get rid of it.	1
4889107	This is definitely a fun game. But it can be risky. I was playing it and enjoying it when it froze. So after the bar on the bottom didnt respond I hit the power button and then tried to turn my kindle back on. Nope. Nothing. I hit the power button again and nothing happened. This continued for about 5 minutes until finally the screen showed. But the touch screen wasnt working. WTF. So I had to turn off  my kindle (hold the power button for about 15 seconds)without the touch screen, which fixed the problem. Pretty fun game, but seems glitchy.	3
4890527	dosnt even download.  wtf???  it would be nice if it &agrave;ctually downloaded for kindle fire because I actually want to use this thingummy mobaber	1
4891405	Fun game but AI really seems favored. Also,  upon rolling doubles to get out of jail the AI gets to roll again (cuz of doubles) but when I roll doubles to get out of jail I don't get to roll again. Why do they get an extra roll!? Wtf! I wanna cheat too! 1 Star for sure until they even out the AI.	1
4892395	graphics ok. everything else works ok but. all 5 games I played the opponent got not one but both of the Boardwalk and Park Place squares.. first few coincidence, next few started over right after he got them and the 5th time i decided WTF and quit playing altogether..  get it together guys. didnt seem to matter the difficulty level either..  bummed cuz i love a good game of Monopoly. just not a rigged one.	2
4892648	bought it 2 hours ago and nothing downloaded yet. WTF! My child doesn't understand when.his other bros and sis games have downloaded and they have been.playing them!	1
4895011	Alright so I read the reviews and decided to check it out myself. And you guys are right!! The frosting just hangs in the air! Seriously wtf is the point of that - it looks retarted! If it weren't for that it would be a lot more fun. Uninstalled.	1
4895102	Fun, addictive. If you like Fruit Ninja, you will enjoy this. Minor changes to FN gameplay keep it fun and worthwhile even if you have the original.  No leaderboards WTF? The iOS version has them, but they're missing here. Odd.	4
4895208	Won't pet me play. It's sad because I love it on my Atrix. wtf Gameloft? Is this just an issue with Amazon marketplace. Can't tell but either way sucky.	2
4897460	required wifi download, 4G dling at over 10 mb a second is not good enough huh? then to be assaulted by paid games inside a paid app? Wtf...	1
4897755	I love this game it's so simple and barbaric that its great. I mean throwing birds at pity's wtf mate?!?	4
4897853	As stated. You do get 9 games. 4 in the arcade section, and 5 in the 2600 section. But.. Millipede and centipede are in both. Yes not the same version but still the same game. Also, wtf with the &quot;basic math&quot; game?	3
4897991	Me being my car enthusiast self, I downloaded this app. Problem one, there are SOOOOO many cars that you will lose your mind over!! Second problem, the photos used to show you the model; some of the don't even relate to that specific model... suck as an old beat up car and its Adel in the photo group labled FERRARI 458 ITALIA... WTF!!!! Overall a great app... 3 Stars.	3
4899183	More than half of the games require a 99 cent upgrade. WTF!  I'm glad I got this POS for free.	1
4899317	NOT A VERY GOOD GAME AT ALL I CAN NOT GET PASSED LEVEL 3 WTF I AM GOING TO REMOVE THIS APP.	1
4899373	Really? A free app that you then have to turn around and BUY the additional content to actually play the games? WTF? Uninstalled faster than you can say Superman75. Thanks for nothing today Amazon	1
4899701	I'm not quick to knock other developers but daaamn! I gave this app a chance because Amazon was offering the base app and 9 games free. well it ate the one game I paid for which was Tempest. Upgrade from free version and loose the games you paid for? WTF!?	3
4899765	so I was almost finished with level 5 about to go to the next stage when this bogus update caused me to start over from the beginning. I lost my whole closet which was almost 4000 in hotness my cash at almost 40 and every free gift that I got from countless boyfriends. wtf. worst of all I didn't see how anything had changed with this update. I'll be deleting this app after this review for wasting my effing time . screw you crowdstar	2
4900163	It was the free app of the day so I got it.. But u have to pay for all the games in it.. Wtf if you gotta pay for the games in it, then why pay for the appstore (for the people that get it when its not free anymore )	1
4902955	I love it on iPad, but it seems a little jumpy on Kindle Fire, especially when zoomed in close. As well, stroke smoothing--like towards the end of the stroke--looks, well, not so smooth, again especially when zoomed in. I guess its just Android? or is it the Kindle? (probably the Kindle...I hope)<br /><br />also wtf is this? .10 crossed out and the price is 1.99? Thanks Amazon. :P maybe I should have waited till it dropped in price again. so far I think ive paid more than any other reviewer for this app.<br /><br />I'll probably stick to the iPad for this app. So I guess I wasted two bucks just to review it.	4
4903501	downloaded this crappy app cause it was on top free apps, today it charged me $3, wtf? trying to get my money back now	1
4903581	Was not expecting much at all.  I was amazed. Huge download on the front end but so worth it. Great graphics, fun multiplayer and the controls are actually useable.  I had no issues downloading or playing. Just make sure you are on a decent connection because it is not some puny little 30meg download.  only complaint I have is I can play for 3 months then there is a monthly fee. wtf???!! they should be a little more upfront about the eventual subscription. If I wanted that I would WOW it on pc. otherwise this is a great game. hell I think its the only mmo on kindle. And no this is not one of those retarded trying-to-pass-it-off-as-an-mmorpg Facebook b.s. games like Mafia wars or that vampire one.  the real deal here.  I bought it for $6.99 and its well worth it. I see its now. 99cents. you have no excuse for not getting it.	5
4907701	Early on I loved this game.  I still love the origional and Rio, but the idiotic wifi requirements and occasional video ads (which have sound when the rest of the app does not, WTF!) make me wonder what kind of crack Rovio is smoking.  If you feel you are expending too much effort to maintain the game as free, then release addon packs or market seasons separately or something.  Don't mark an app as ad-free then put in the worst kind of ads.	2
4909266	while playing 9ball the Droid hit the 9 in while there were still 5 balls on the table,it then goes Droid wins,WTF is this?	3
4910465	it wont install and since it wont install i cant UNinstall.  cant play the game.  whats the secret to install?  the game just sits there in my notifications.  save for later or not saved still in my notifications wtf?	1
4911081	im.pretty pissed off that i paid for this bs!!! it downloaded but wen it goes to install it just restarts my damn phone!!! seems like everyone with an optimus v is havin this problem so wtf!! FIX IT OR REFUND ME MY DAMN MONEY!!!	1
4912702	WTF<WTF< WTF< I paid for this awsome app already in the android market...now I have to pay again.....no way...WTF  This is a perfect example of poor customer service.	1
4912896	where is the widget???? WTF of needs to have one to compare to the best other apps like this. put a widget in asap	3
4913135	"Was completely ready to hop on here and give this game a great review at first but... Around level 4 or 5...  To the developers,   Dudes, you SERIOUSLY need to take or re-take that Game-Development class! Because you obviously forgot (or never learned) that, if you stair-step the difficulty as opposed to adhere to the curve- YOU DO SO INCREMENTALLY!!!! And, you SURE in the heck do NOT do a \\""major jump\\"" IN THE EASIER MODES!!!! This means that, while you CAN \\""jump\\"" the higher difficulty choices you STILL go incrementally for the easier ones! And, last, but by NO means least: MAKE SURE YOUR MECHANICS ARE SOLID!!!!  If y'all had PAID attention in class, then you would KNOW that just pi$$es people off and creates bad word of mouth.  As it stands, all I can say is that this is a great \\""third draft\\"" (it's far better than a First One- and you're nearly there), I will give you guys that much but, please, go back to school for a semester or two in order to polish this thing a bit more because you're difficulty levels and your accuracy are both a mess.  You've got towers idly standing by and doing nothing even when NOT stunned while enemies pass- you have enemies of the same kind passing by said towers with zero damage even AFTER being hit WHILE IN \\""CASUAL MODE\\""...  As a gamer, the only thing I'm left with is... WTF?!!!....  From an insider perspective? You are soooooo close but you seemed to have overlooked your \\""final read\\"" and, \\""spell check...\\""  It's a great idea and it's a great work in progress and, as soon as you finish it, I WILL pay for it but, until then? I can only warn people to not waste their money until you do...."	2
4913486	Doesn't remember my login info. Wants me to accept a paid kibble (wtf?) for the free app of the day. Doesn't let me enter trip details myself; HAVE to forward a confirmation...I didn't make the arrangements so I don't have that conf to send... and what if it wasn't done via comp??	1
4913722	Not really free.  Won't use it much.  Requires subscription. Wtf.  Amazon needs to put up some decent useful apps. Used both the ad and ad free versions. Not worth it.	1
4915707	You can't download the app for Android In Australia, why the hell is it blocked?<br />Yet someone in thier wisdom think's it's fine on iO/s for iPads in Australia where you can download it...?<br />WTF is going on Amazon? Sort out access to your products and apps in Australia.<br />You are a global company, and we want to buy from you, fix it!	1
4915708	cannot remove from device and updates on it's own. WTF? IS my personal info safe? who knows?  factory reset is imminent.	1
4915755	Why isn't this the same newer version as on the google PLAY Store?<br /><br />Amazon seems to have old versions of apps. Wtf!	1
4915827	4 stars for being FREE, NOYCE graphics, and the fluidy of the game excellent!. Minus a star since file cannot b moved to sd, and Victor*?  WTF! They couldn't think of other names really... But could have been worst like Pablo. No offense. I still got over 300MB internally so I'm fine with it. This game for sure is a keeper until something comes along the way that's much better. My phone still works fine wit it. ;)  Strykher Mytouch 4G	5
4916071	I am SO sorry I didn't notice the reviews... NO SINGLE PLAYER OPTION! WtF?  wait until they update it but until.then forget it....	1
4917206	no single player! WTF!!! what an absolute waste of $2.99<br />just assumed it would have what the other mobile apps had...my bad...buyer beware.	1
4917746	the name Exchange is misleading.  Microsoft Exchange requires both incoming.and.outgoing servers.  There is no way to enter more than one server address. Lists M.S. Exchange 2003 or 2007 as server configure optionds but.then only.one.place to.input server address. WTF??!	1
4918582	Normally I would submit reviews after playing a game, and would give it constuctive crisisism (as much as I can, anyway). But, WTF Devolver, what is with the **** premissions?  A game like this would only need to access and write to the SD card, which is a pretty good way of handling game data. And for a game without ads and multiplayer, why does it need NETWORK ACCESS!?!?!?!?!?!?! And, why does anything (other than system/diagnosis utilites, benchmarks, and Tasker) need to ACCESS THE PHONE STATE, AND OPEN UP MORE PRIVACY HOLES?!!?!?! This is SPYWARE!!!! If you would modify the app so that it does not spy on us, then this will get more than a 1 star. Even if the actual game was good, it's absloutly INEXCUSABLE TO ACCESS PHONE STATE WHEN THE APP IS A GAME!!!!!! Plus the game itself, I heard, is not that good.  Devolver, please modify this application so that it does not have such ridiciolus premissions. And Amazon, this app should be removed untill the developer fixes the application. Oh, and why have you given it more attention than the ACTUALL GOOD APPS OUT THERE, LIKE QUELL AND THE ANGRY BIRDS SERIES?!?!?!?!  Over and out, W. Imm.  EDIT: Appearently there has been a new update that removes the ridicilous premissions (were they some sort of debug thing that was not taken out before release?) Since it's not really free anymore, I can't try the actual game, but if I do, I will change the rating on this game.	1
4919228	The only thing more cumbersome than trying to navigate the CBS Sports website on my Epic 4G is trying to get this app to do what I want it to do. Tell me, why is it that in the height of the fantasy football season, this app does nothing related to FFL? If I cant access and work with my team, what is the point of this app. It keeps directing me to fantasy baseball! WTF!?!?! Seriously? IT'S NOVEMBER! Expand your app and make it more user friendly. Even though the app was free, I feel CBS owes me some kind of refund on time wasted between their app and their mobile website. I'm moving my league to ESPN next year. Their app works...	1
4919486	Yeah it's free on Amazon today, but it's data mining you're phone taking screen shots wtf stay away. Amazon should be ashamed.	1
4919501	I buy the kindle fire and I live in Honduras wen I try to download an app they give me the message that I'm not in a region something! wtf that not suppose to happen, now I don't. know what to do!!!	1
4919777	1 reading experience is great....BUT<br />2 logging in EVERY TIME. wtf??<br />3 current version of mag not available 10 days after the paper version arrived<br /><br />very disappointed	1
4920428	The graphics are decent but the game itself needs work. There is no exit button for the app, wtf? Now i have to rely on a task manager to end its processes. Meh. Uninstalled	3
4922100	This is one of my absolute favorite apps for my iphone. This version, however, is lacking. The feeds are terrible and the bugs are annoying. The record feature is all mssed up. Cant set end time? WTF? Glad I paid for this version when the free version is just as good. Its not worth your money if you're on a kindle fire. Just get the free app. I just got ripped off.	3
4922354	for 2 days ive tried to load this game and it keeps crashing my htc 3g slide... it keeps rebooting my phone?? wtf?	1
4925187	I put 8 hours into this game because it was really fun and engrossing. BUT it uninstalled itself after 3 days. WTF!	1
4925321	I should have known this was gonna suck when I saw they spelled &quot;cannon&quot; wrong in the description.... The controls (ie- tap the screen) are not in sync with the game. I tap, a circle appears where i tap, then a delay, then it shoots the puffle someplace else 75% of the time...WTF? I can see by the circle that my aim and timing were good, but then the game hesitates and shoots it into the sky. Not sure if its supposed to do this because I only get a few tries before the game force closes on me. I expect much more from Disney.... :-(	1
4925556	Srsly Amazon App Store needs to let you back out of a d/l for apps like these; I had no WiFi access but App Store kept trying to download! I had to uninstall App Store to stop attempted download of this app so battery wouldn't needlessly drain!  3 stars for Bejeweled 2 because it's freakin' Bejeweled, but -1 for 40mb size and def. -1 for permissions required. WTF EA?!?	3
4926158	Is this right?  Installed it and everything was in chinese.  WTF?  Uninstalled.  Pretty disappointed with amazon for allowing this. Also, as others have noted, SMS permissions shouldn't be needed.	1
4926406	Without a doubt my absolute favorite keyboard replacement ever. Period. I love it so much I repurchased it here. Says a lot. This app was taken down from the Android Market and left a lot of us hanging. Its got gorgeous HD skins. Huge customization options. It also has a abbreviation replacement engine like Blackberries do. For instance I've programmed this keyboard to automatically turn 'brb' into be right back and 'wtf' in to what the **** (not gonna actually say it but you get the idea xD) the keyboard is powerful and lightweight and feels good. You will not regret this purchase. I promise you that. &#12483;	5
4927044	decided to give hulu a try. went to download the app only to have it say my dx wasn't compatible. then 5 min later amazon's slow as crap d/l finished and guess what app is there? hulu plus. wtf? so I try it out it works but I'm not paying $8.00 a month to have commercials on my viewing choices. bye hulu.	1
4927646	My wife got this on her iPhone, and it was awesome. I downloaded it on Android and was like, wtf.	1
4929098	This game has been trying to install for 24 hours. I can't even restart the installation because its literally stuck in installation mode. Wtf! Will re-rate if it ever works.	1
4929922	Plays fine on my Optimus S, so I gave it 3 stars because it's a decent game. But it has a HUGE flaw. At 25mb it absolutely MUST have &quot;move to sd card&quot; enabled. Wtf is the dev thinking. That will be a deal breaker for a lot of people besides me. Uninstalled.	3
4932131	just updated and lost all my cars and $. WTF I was on level 10 and now I have to start all over, done playing this game.	4
4937759	i have had this app on my bb curve and htc tb, both show no problems viewing live feeds or whatever playback those cameras show. i always see video, idk wtf yall r doing to see only pictures.	5
4938651	This app ruined my relationship. Me and dis girl were going steady then she be looking through my phone and she say &quot;kids paint, you got kids!!!&quot;, she ain't done want a man with kids, so she drop me like I drop fresh lycs in da studio. Den I was like &quot;shake to clear&quot; wtf, I puts me phone in my blendtech and day cleared it aight, now Amazon owe me a new phone. /end sarcasm.	4
4939513	wow a raptor that shoots things out of its head at bull looking coins that split to smaller bull looking coins?!? Seriously WTF are they on that not only did they come up with this idea, but programmed it, and published thus garbage. Controls: very difficult Graphics: great bright and colorful  Gameplay: stupid as hell makes no sense what so ever, flat out the most idiotic idea ever.	1
4939676	I spent all day waiting for my phone to FINALLY update my game on my phone. It finally got down, now I can't open it. It's a black screen....WTF!!	1
4941045	i cant even open it! its like 12 MB and when i finally get it installed, it wont even boot! it just force closes the second i tap on it!!! WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!	1
4941838	bought for 99. wint even open on my galaxy.  wtf! this is crap. if anyone knows a trick plz let me know.	1
4945716	A 7 page license? Seriously? The app is cool but wtf? Really like the videos which appear within an hour or so of the live action.	3
4946013	If this were April, it's a great deal but in September?  WTF!  The app itself is decent although it sucks to need to buy both the MLB subscription AND the app.  Fail.	1
4947067	After one or two levels, it causes my phone to reboot! not just force closes, but REBOOT!! WTF?! if anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know. Thanks. *tmobile Galaxy S 4g	1
4949445	I have tried to download this several times, but it keeps telling me the appropriate has changed and won't download &quot;null&quot;.  wtf?	1
4949920	I can't even get past registration because EVERYTHING I put in is already taken. Yeah I doubt my first and middle name with an underscore and numbers is already taken. Wtf.	2
4950600	Rating: 4.55 Stars. I receive about 200 emails avg/day at work - at least half of which require quick 2-3 sentence responses an TD never lets me down. I tried all the other MS Exchange apps but returned toTD for the interface (tablet version is ridic awesoms), robust yet navigable feature set, and of earnest importantance to work-related apps. TD actually receives and sends email via push in real-ish time. In constrast to &quot;Stock App&quot; that struggles thru sync, Roadsync is not worth comparing, K-9 is forever alpha testing, Moxymail actually lost emails in the Outbox. Anyway - its worth a Jackson for reliable straightforward exchange access on Android and thanks to TD I don't worry about the bomb  (Nexus One 2.3.4 and Acer A500 3.2)  &#363; Moxymail lost as theyemails in Outbox (WTF?)	5
4951402	You can t zoom wtf is that all about, other lens programs r much much doper yall. Like this proven programs whack as crack	2
4951471	uh...so the program launched and immediately has to shut down with a error message on my impression android tablet....wtf? anyone else cmon let me post my comment!	1
4951619	So really cool effects but on my droidx there is a loud clicking or typewriter sound. WTF is up with that? Get rid of that sound and you get 5 stars	2
4951876	I don't understand WTF this app even does! every time I get a new app it asks if I want to put it in a folder. I say yes but then when I go to the folder there's nothing in it!   But if you love Hip-Hop you will love The LoAd! It's cumin soon! If you're interested hit me up TheLoAd2011@hotmail.com	3
4952288	So glad it showed me zero traffic at the entrance to the Holland tunnel... When I got there the traffic was out of control.. Turns out the camera image was from 2009!! Wtf?	2
4953255	so... I was excited to finally get the newest update, came out 8/31. after dloading and installing update my app was corrupt , forced close, forced restart, and is now completely gone from my EVO 4g without option to redownload in amazon without paying again. wtf? anyone else have this issue?	3
4953602	$2.99 with advertisements wtf is that a joke or somtin works well but if you pay you shouldn't get ads wat a joke.	3
4954697	Nice music its a good game! Its been awhile since I bought an app. Wont give it 5 stars cuz they make you rate it...wtf?	4
4955022	I installed it, went to go onto the android market, and and it wouldn't let me on because I needed to log into my google account. Because of the permissions, I uninstalled this game, and all of a sudden I could get into my market without logging in! Wtf Konami?	1
4955099	The game isn't bad but after getting one frog across this annoying music starts playing over and over and NEVER stops! I quit and it was STILL playing!  I had to force close it to get it to stop!  WTF?  I'm glad I didn't pay for this or I'd be pissed...  Droid X.	2
4955460	Android market says update...so now what as I was asked to purchase.  Amazon abandons there apps after free?  WTF LAME	2
4955805	good fun app. however after this last update all my scores were deleted, wtf. I almost had the game beat, this is garbage.	3
4955876	This version is older than the latest on the Android Market. This older version is also free on the Android market. Wtf?	1
4956730	Locks up after going through the guide of how to play and changing the car color? I needs lots improvement of it can&apos;t run on a dual core cpu wtf?	1
4957636	yes it organizes your apps so YOU. can put them on your sd card. this app should do it on its own. wtf is the pro version for if it does the samething the free version does. if I could make a review with zero stars I would.	1
4957844	1. To the dork who said it can not move to sd card . . . IT CAN.\n2. To the other dork who gave it 1 star then said it was great . . . WTF?\n3. Finally, this game is awesome!	5
4957938	two words lol this is stupid it doesnt even have good words\n... pope plunger was the first one, then like dog sniffer... wtf stupid	1
4958236	This was force-downloaded onto my Droid this morning.  WTF!!!  I will never buy a Kindle because of this, and Amazon is going to hear from me.  I've never requested ANY apps from Amazon, so how they could think I would want this I have no idea.    Verizon says it can't control what 3rd parties can download into my phone if they have my phone number, which Amazon says it needs for deliveries.  I have to install it before I can remove/uninstall it, can't just delete, and I don't want to install it!  This really pisses me off.	1
4958412	I can start it up and everything but every time i score a goal it force closes...wtf would be fun it worked. HTC EVO 3D	1
4959195	As has already been said by others, task killers are pointless and often will do more harm than good in the Android ecosystem.  Unfortunately some people will undoubtedly try this and be tricked into thinking it will do them some good.\n\nAs for the idiot who gave it 5* and hasn&apos;t tried it (nor knows anything about his phone apparently) WTF...\n\nAs for the idiot complaining about it not being free...  get a clue and wait a few.\n\nAnd as for those who will pad this apps stars to make up for the people who gave one star due to impatience and not waiting till it registered for free...  Please don&apos;t help out useless apps.  Try them and if they are good then drop an extra star to make up for it.	1
4959773	it&apos;s called football but it&apos;s actually soccer, Wtf, don&apos;t the devs know their sports?! im really disappointed. there&apos;s even a soccer ball in the logo! why didn&apos;t an editor catch this?...	1
4960970	it is asking me to add payment method. so far I downloaded many apps, this one only require it ..wtf..	1
4961014	This is garbage. It&apos;s cheaper and more convenient to just buy the daily printed newspaper. At least with a real newspaper ads aren&apos;t forced upon you and your information isn&apos;t logged. Wtf?	1
4962576	played the game for a little bit so far and enjoyed it. it tough get tough  fast (wtf moon), but it will be good for passing time	5
4962975	I don&apos;t know how anyone can say this is a good app as at its heart it&apos;s counterintuative. You open a Word file, and try to write on it. Oh wait, you can simply type no, you have to go to the menu button, click through to MORE and select Edit! WTF? Why do I need an edit button? I don&apos;t need that on a desktop so why do I need it on my phone? I should be able to click on the app and start typing. nope, doesn&apos;t work that way. Second if it has to use an edit button because of some assinine requirement of Android fine. At LEAST put it as the first selection of the menu. Its pretty much the only reason you buy this app! Sheesh it worked more like a document editor on old Palm Treo than it does on my new Evo! I mean c&apos;mon, really? So counter unintuative I actually uninstalled it even though I paid the money for it just out of irritation from using it! Download Evernote instead! it&apos;s hands down better and it ain&apos;t $15 bucks!	1
4963094	So I figured, I don&apos;t know much about grilling, maybe this would help a little. eeh not really. one of the things to grill calls for a lime in the ingredients section. Then it goes into the prep. area and tells me to put lemon juice on it! I thought u said lime. WTF!	1
4963534	Opened app and tried to sign up. Error message says &quot;Call requires two legged Oauth authentication&quot; wtf does that mean?!	1
4963584	I love trivia, but this is stupid. I just want trivia in categories that I recognize, not NHL captains. WTF? I love hockey, but that is too trivial. Uninstalled. Go away, sporkle.	1
4963929	So everyone thinks they are &quot;god&quot; when reviewing a application on here. Is this the best app ever? No. Is it the worst app ever? No. The guitar hero series was originally made for high end gaming systems people! Since when can your android device go harder than a xbox360, or a ps3? Ya that&apos;s what I thought, you have a PHONE, and it just happens that someone thought they would make a amazing game franchise game that normally runs on a gaming system for a phone and this is the kind of rating you give them? Wtf is wrong with you people?!?! Oh, boo who, i can&apos;t play an entire song.... You pay for the royalties for the full songs and lets see how much money you have left to develop a game. \n\nMy hats off to the developers for this game. Thank you.	5
4965385	Last update totally deleted all of my settings and feeds! WTF!!! Why? Why? Why? Uninstalling this crap. Thanks for nothing!	1
4965610	fun game great dialogue only serious problem is its buggy! constant fc and also whats up with these towers that have infinite health? ill attack get it down to 4, next attack (on same turn) they have 10 again! wtf?? please fix...	3
4966892	Auto space is always on.  Wtf gives.  I guess i just need to adjust to the keyboard. New neon skin is cool, left out in the beta.	4
4968260	My first review worthy app! Brings me back to the golden age of yore. (No idea wtf that means but it sounds good!) You can really relive the arcade asteroids games of the 80's w this game. And the locked levels and challenges to complete gives it hours and hours of replay value. Lots of complaints of the controls but I became quite comfortable w them quite quickly, personally.	5
4968684	This app is a letdown for people who have slow networks &amp; need to download Youtube videos VS watching streaming content. I was only able to convert videos to mp3. WTF!	1
4970552	App does exactly what it advertises and does it well.  People rating this poorly due to a lack of grams as a measure of volume (WTF) or because it's not something they would use and they want something &quot;better&quot; (wahhhh!) is a pretty sad reflection on the state of America.	4
4971102	Nice graphics, good on tablet (but would prefer a landscape option), but there are NO rules or guidelines. Hunted all over for them (not many places for them to hides) but it seems to be assumed that everyone knows exactly how to play this and doesn't need any guidance. WTF?	3
4971876	I do not own this app! But I love it. In my mind I bowled a 300.  One thing I don't like...it doesn't help my real life bowling game...wtf?	5
4971932	this game is great, just like the original pc version, but seriously pop cap WTF!! 75 megs are you kidding me... i have over 100 megs of space available on my phone and yet everytime i try to download this game i am greeted with a not enough space please remove some applications prompt, now i dont have a single app or game installed on my phone, this was going to be the first, you need to make the game file small and have a additional game file download when you start the game for the first time. maybe then i will be able to install this game. i can not say anything bad about the game cause it is great which is why i gave it 5 stars but i am royaly pissed that i cant play it on my phone, i dont normally carry my tablet everywhere i go. please fix the large file issue.	5
4972082	since i started using this I've been getting nothing else but solicitations wtf gives. Are you selling my number seems wayyyy to coincidental.	2
4973214	Dog didnt flinch. Cat sitting nearby woke from his nap and glared at me as though to say wtf? Besides, i could hear it.	1
4973736	fun, but after getting the paid version, I'm surprised that in place of ads, i now get commercials that lock up my phone when I refuse to watch them. WTF!  Amazon won't let me put this on the paid either. stick with getting the free version and use airplane mode.	2
4973969	Havent upgraded to android 2.2 so the game wouldnt run for me :( ay least there was a nice friendly message letting me know I needed to upgrade rather than the game just crashing and leaving me thinking &quot;wtf?!&quot; Gonna upgrade later on after I wake up and cant wait to play this game sounds fun! Thanks amazon for the free apps!	4
4974555	i love this game. i had it downloaded on my old phone so there is no reason why it won't work on my droid 1 even tho its older. it gets to the title screen and freezes to then finally closing. wtf? i tried opening it several times after and i finally got it to the screen where you input your name and then it crashes! someone fix this pos version of this game. free or not don't offer garbage!	1
4976072	well the app lacked content! you can't pick any shows! wtf! please dd some shows. breaking bad, msnbc news or something!	1
4976200	my only problem with this app is that it is sometimes inconsistent with the items shown daily on the front page of the store. the free song &amp; the sale album should, in my opinion, always be there. a featured 69 cent song is a nice addition, but shouldn't replace either &amp; the same goes for a featured $5 album.   i don't use the cloud player from my phone often, but haven't had any problems yet. i love that my purchased songs from the site or the app go immediately to the cloud. way better to have this than some other cloud players i've tried, like the one that requires your computer at home to be on so you can listen from your phone while you're out... wtf?	4
4976347	tried to sign up and never even finished and it said i was banned for violating TOS. wtf is up with that?	1
4976395	"Collapse! It's one of the fun games in the block-falling-square themed-tetris type genre. I used to love to play it on the computer. Ported to Android! Yes. June 2011 update is a COMPLETE FAILURE. If you have it and have not updated yet, DON'T do it. I have an HTC EVO. Collapse now uses 1/3 of the screen. Bg music is gone and sound fx. The map was detailed prior to the update and had better graphics. Now it is just a boxy interface and is garbage. Who wants to play a game on a smartphone that's using 1/3 of the screen. WTF is a 4.3\\"" screen for? It seems like someone dropped the ball and ported an old version to update. I'll keep it around just to see if they fix it. Otherwise, its going in the deleted items folder."	1
4976402	One of the laziest developed apps. No search capability! WTF? It won't update for days on end, have to force close constantly. Use your browser instead. Droid X.	1
4977556	it seems like a fun game, but froze my phone. and somehow my texts disappeared after restart? wtf strange. mytouch4g	2

4981520	Doesn't work on my Fascinate. Hourglass and then black, that's all it does. uninstalled and reinstalled. No difference. Redownloaded and reinstalled. No difference.<br /><br />Also, wtf with Droid incompatibility? My wife is super disappointed. It probably wouldn't have worked anyway...	1
4981636	so I love this game on iPhone. I got it for Android and can't sign in. I can't type anything. WTF!!! its the simple things that piss ya off.	1
4981945	Seriously WTF?  This is not even worth the effort it took to download.  Not only did my dog not react to any frequency but HE DID NOT REACT TO ANY FREQUENCY.  it was more annoying to me.	1
4982087	One of the better free apps offered by amazon app  store that I have downloaded.Thats twenty words wtf wont it post pffffft	5
4984130	2:52 for a nightmare puzzle is better than 62% of others using autopencil?! wtf?!  people do not solve Sudoku this fast.	5
4984524	I actually downloaded this from the VZW Android Market, but they no longer have it. Says this is FREE, but when l try to download it insists that I set a payment option?  WTF?  It is the easiest root to be foumd, and works great on my DroidX running 2.2.1	5
4985559	Forcing a user to use wifi in order to download an app is moronic and outdated. My 4g service is faster than my home internet...wtf. Dont waste your money on this crap.	1

4993431	Bout F'n time one of these Android flashlight apps supports use of the camera LED.  This was supported years ago on WinMo 5!!! WTF.  This app works beautifully.  Thank you.	5
4994660	Very solid. Intuitive interface. Has 7 or so services that it can connect to, AIM, Windows Live,  etc. But no Skype! Wtf? The Microsoft of instant messaging and it's not included. But my version was free, thanks to Amazon, so I can't complain too much. Just keep that in mind. I'm certain they'll add Skype in the future, but not sure when.	4
4994840	I have read a couple reviews about the update that is now here. seems that the paid version now has ads, wtf!!! what kinda crap is this?? if this is the case I will not be updating. rather have no ads than a studip extra level. can anyone confirm this??	2
4995449	The Android Market already has the Easter update!  WTF Amazon?   The rest of the review is to fill the twenty-five word minimum. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah.	1
4996616	Force closes 60% of the time. Only 15 levels too, wtf this is a paid app you can do better than this for the cost.	3
4997266	But i got it free,  wouldnt waste money on it.  Thats all i have to say about it but the amazon App store has a 25 word minimum before you can post (WTF srsly?) Going back to stock google app store FTW.	4
4999109	It's ok I guess not as fast as I thought it would be. But u get what u pay for and the free version and paid version are like the same they have pretty much no difference and the free version is newer than the old version wtf o O	1
4999419	This is not a paid app for free this is a lite or demo version. All it is is tackle alley showing off the game. Wtf. If yoir gonna say paid apps for free then be a paid app for free. Dont try and sucker people with trash and advertisements	1
4999950	I down loaded just fine and then after install I got a pop up alert that my firmware was too old...i cheched the software and it was up to date...wtf I want a refund	1
5000042	it surprises me the number of reviews with horrible spelling... did you purposely break your auto correct? or do you think it is wrong all the time? WTF people.   okay app review: you have a few air strips you get to land planes, jets and helicopters on. the three appear at random and you must guide them to the landing areas. the three aerial vehicle types appear with increasing frequency as the game progresses and continues until you crash a vehicle.  the game is scored based upon how many aerial vehicles were safely landed. the more objects landed successfully, the higher the player score. seems simple and easy but it is difficult at times.  is this a good primary game? absolutely not. this game is a great supplemental game to play when you are bored or when you are too frustrated with other game apps. it is good to keep your game collection well rounded.  the graphics are simple, the game is straightforward, that is all there is to it.	5
5000228	"EVERY time I try and connect the android app, I get an error 70, and the stupid app tells me I need to try again from an area with cellular or wifi service. Yet EVERY TIME, I'm connected to my home Wifi, and EVERY other program has no problem. WTF Amazon? Didn't get a reply back about my support issue for two days now, not even a \\""we're working on it\\"" message. So far it's a complete waste of time and money."	1
